## What is Network Segmentation?

**Network Segmentation** is a security practice that divides a network into smaller, isolated segments or zones. This approach improves security by limiting access between segments, reducing the attack surface, and containing potential breaches to prevent lateral movement by attackers.

## Types of Segmentation

### **Macrosegmentation**
- **Department-based** – Separate segments for HR, Finance, IT
- **Function-based** – Production, development, testing environments
- **Data sensitivity** – Public, internal, confidential, restricted zones
- **User groups** – Employees, contractors, guests

### **Microsegmentation**
- **Application-level** – Individual applications or services
- **User-level** – Specific user or device access
- **Workload-based** – Virtual machines or containers
- **API-level** – Individual API endpoints

## Implementation Methods

### **Physical Segmentation**
- **Air gaps** – Complete physical separation
- **Separate networks** – Different hardware and cabling
- **Dedicated infrastructure** – Isolated servers and switches

### **Logical Segmentation**
- **VLANs** – Virtual Local Area Networks
- **Subnets** – IP address-based separation
- **Firewalls** – Traffic filtering between segments
- **Software-defined networking** – Programmatic control

## Benefits

- **Containment** – Limits the spread of malware and attacks
- **Access Control** – Restricts unauthorized access to sensitive areas
- **Performance** – Reduces network congestion and improves speed
- **Compliance** – Helps meet regulatory requirements
- **Monitoring** – Easier to detect and respond to threats

## Best Practices

- **Segment by data sensitivity** – Isolate critical systems
- **Apply least privilege** – Only allow necessary communication
- **Monitor inter-segment traffic** – Log and analyze all connections
- **Regular testing** – Verify segmentation effectiveness
- **Documentation** – Maintain clear network architecture diagrams
- **Automation** – Use tools to enforce segmentation policies
- **Regular reviews** – Update segmentation as network evolves
