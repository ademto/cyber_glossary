## What is Network Segmentation?

**Network Segmentation** improves security by splitting a network into smaller zones. This limits access and helps contain threats, reducing how far attackers can move within a compromised system.

## Key Concepts

- **Macrosegmentation** – Large zones by department or function
- **Microsegmentation** – Fine-grained, user/device-level separation
- **Access Control Lists** – Define allowed communications

## Best Practices

- Segment sensitive data zones (e.g., payment systems)
- Monitor and log traffic between segments
- Use firewalls and VLANs strategically
- Apply least privilege to inter-segment communication
