## What is Cryptomalware?

**Cryptomalware** is a type of ransomware that encrypts files or entire systems and demands payment, typically in cryptocurrency, for the decryption keys. It is one of the most financially damaging forms of malware, targeting individuals, businesses, and critical infrastructure.

## How Cryptomalware Works

### **Infection Phase**
- **Delivery** – Phishing emails, exploit kits, compromised websites
- **Execution** – Malicious code runs and begins encryption
- **Persistence** – Establishes foothold in the system

### **Encryption Phase**
- **File scanning** – Identifies target files and systems
- **Encryption** – Uses strong algorithms to encrypt data
- **Key generation** – Creates unique encryption keys

### **Extortion Phase**
- **Ransom note** – Displays payment instructions
- **Payment demand** – Usually cryptocurrency (Bitcoin, Monero)
- **Deadline** – Threatens permanent data loss

## Prevention Strategies

- **Regular backups** – Air-gapped, immutable backups
- **Email filtering** – Advanced threat protection
- **Endpoint protection** – EDR/XDR solutions
- **Network segmentation** – Isolate critical systems
- **Patch management** – Keep systems updated
- **Security awareness training** – Phishing simulation
- **Incident response planning** – Ransomware playbooks

## Response and Recovery

- **Isolate affected systems** – Prevent spread
- **Assess scope** – Identify all compromised systems
- **Preserve evidence** – For forensic analysis
- **Notify authorities** – Law enforcement reporting
- **Restore from backups** – Clean, recent backups
- **Decryption tools** – Free tools from security vendors
- **Professional services** – Incident response teams

## Best Practices

- **Never pay the ransom** – Encourages more attacks
- **Maintain offline backups** – Air-gapped storage
- **Test recovery procedures** – Regular backup testing
- **Implement zero trust** – Verify all access
- **Monitor for indicators** – Early detection systems
