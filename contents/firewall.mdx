## What is a Firewall?

A **Firewall** is a security system that filters network traffic based on defined rules. It creates a barrier between a trusted internal network and untrusted external networks, such as the internet.

## Common Types

- Packet-filtering
- Stateful inspection
- Proxy firewalls
- Next-generation firewalls (NGFW)

## Best Practices

- Follow the principle of least privilege
- Regularly update firewall rules
- Monitor and log denied attempts
- Combine with IDS/IPS for layered defense
