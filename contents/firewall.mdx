## What is a Firewall?

**Firewalls** act as a barrier between trusted internal networks and untrusted external networks. They examine network traffic and decide whether to allow or block it based on predefined security rules.

## Types of Firewalls

- **Packet Filtering Firewalls** – Basic traffic filtering
- **Stateful Firewalls** – Track connection state
- **Application Layer Firewalls** – Deep packet inspection
- **Next-Generation Firewalls** – Advanced threat protection

## Best Practices

- Use defense in depth with multiple firewall layers
- Regularly update firewall rules
- Monitor and log all traffic
- Test firewall configurations regularly
