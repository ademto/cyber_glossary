# Hacktivist

A hacktivist is an individual or group that uses hacking techniques to promote a political, social, or ideological agenda. Hacktivists often target organizations or governments they perceive as unethical or oppressive, using cyber attacks to draw attention to their cause or disrupt operations.

## Characteristics
- **Motivation**: Driven by activism, not financial gain
- **Tactics**: Website defacement, DDoS attacks, data leaks, doxing
- **Targets**: Governments, corporations, law enforcement, NGOs

## Notable Examples
- **Anonymous**: A decentralized hacktivist collective
- **LulzSec**: Known for high-profile attacks and leaks
- **Syrian Electronic Army**: Pro-government hacktivist group

## Common Activities
- **Website Defacement**: Altering websites to display activist messages
- **DDoS Attacks**: Disrupting services to protest or draw attention
- **Data Leaks**: Exposing sensitive information to embarrass or pressure targets
- **Doxing**: Publishing private information about individuals

## Defense Strategies
1. **Monitor for Activist Chatter**: Track social media and forums
2. **Harden Web Applications**: Patch vulnerabilities and use WAFs
3. **DDoS Protection**: Implement anti-DDoS solutions
4. **Incident Response**: Prepare for public relations and technical response

## Challenges
- **Attribution**: Hacktivists often use anonymity tools
- **Public Perception**: Attacks may generate sympathy for the cause
- **Legal Issues**: Responses may have legal and reputational consequences

## Related Concepts
- **State Actor**: Nation-state threats
- **APT**: Advanced persistent threats
- **DDoS Attack**: Common hacktivist tactic

## Conclusion

Hacktivists are motivated by causes rather than profit. Organizations should be prepared for both the technical and reputational impact of hacktivist attacks.
