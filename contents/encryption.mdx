## What is Encryption?

**Encryption** transforms plain data into a coded format that can only be read with a decryption key. It protects the confidentiality of sensitive information and is a cornerstone of secure communication and data storage.

## Common Algorithms

- AES (Advanced Encryption Standard)
- RSA (for public key encryption)
- ECC (Elliptic Curve Cryptography)

## Best Practices

- Use strong, modern encryption standards
- Rotate keys regularly
- Never store plaintext sensitive data
- Use HTTPS for all web traffic
