# Password Cracking

Password cracking is the process of recovering passwords from data stored or transmitted by computer systems. Attackers use automated tools and various techniques to guess or extract passwords, often to gain unauthorized access to systems or data.

## Common Methods
- **Brute Force**: Tries all possible combinations
- **Dictionary Attack**: Uses lists of common passwords
- **Rainbow Tables**: Precomputed tables for reversing cryptographic hash functions
- **Social Engineering**: Manipulating users to reveal passwords

## Tools
- John the Ripper
- Hashcat
- Hydra

## Prevention
1. **Strong Password Policies**: Require complex, unique passwords
2. **Salting and Hashing**: Secure password storage
3. **Account Lockout**: Limit failed login attempts
4. **User Education**: Train users to recognize social engineering

## Detection
- Monitor for unusual login activity
- Use IDS/IPS to detect brute force attempts
- Analyze authentication logs

## Related Concepts
- **Dictionary Attack**: Uses wordlists
- **Brute Force Attack**: Tries all combinations
- **Salting**: Enhances password security

## Conclusion

Password cracking is a significant threat to information security. Strong password policies, secure storage, and monitoring are essential to defend against these attacks.
