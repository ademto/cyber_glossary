## What is Social Engineering?

**Social Engineering** is a non-technical form of attack that relies on human psychology and manipulation. Attackers use various techniques to trick people into breaking normal security procedures, revealing confidential information, or performing actions that compromise security.

## Common Techniques

- **Phishing** – Deceptive emails designed to steal information
- **Pretexting** – Creating a fabricated scenario to gain trust
- **Baiting** – Leaving physical devices to tempt victims
- **Quid Pro Quo** – Offering a service in exchange for information
- **Tailgating** – Following authorized personnel into restricted areas
- **Vishing** – Voice-based phishing attacks

## Psychological Principles

- **Authority** – Impersonating someone in power
- **Urgency** – Creating time pressure to bypass thinking
- **Social Proof** – Using peer pressure or consensus
- **Reciprocity** – Offering something to create obligation
- **Scarcity** – Making opportunities seem limited

## Prevention Strategies

- Conduct regular security awareness training
- Implement multi-factor authentication
- Verify identities through multiple channels
- Establish clear reporting procedures
- Use technical controls to reduce human error
- Foster a security-conscious culture
