# OSSEC

OSSEC (Open Source HIDS Security) is an open-source host-based intrusion detection system that provides comprehensive security monitoring capabilities. It combines log analysis, file integrity monitoring, Windows registry monitoring, centralized policy enforcement, rootkit detection, and real-time alerting to protect systems from various security threats.

## What is OSSEC?

OSSEC is a multi-platform host-based intrusion detection system that monitors system logs, file integrity, and system changes to detect and respond to security incidents. It operates on individual hosts and can be managed centrally, making it suitable for both standalone systems and large enterprise deployments.

## Key Features

### Log Analysis
- **Real-time Log Monitoring**: Analyzes system logs for suspicious patterns
- **Cross-platform Support**: Works on Windows, Linux, macOS, and BSD systems
- **Custom Log Formats**: Supports various log formats and applications
- **Correlation Engine**: Links related events across different sources

### File Integrity Monitoring
- **File Change Detection**: Monitors critical system files for modifications
- **Hash-based Verification**: Uses cryptographic hashes to detect changes
- **Baseline Creation**: Establishes known-good file states
- **Scheduled Scanning**: Regular integrity checks on specified intervals

### Rootkit Detection
- **Hidden Process Detection**: Identifies processes hidden by rootkits
- **Kernel Module Monitoring**: Detects unauthorized kernel modifications
- **System Call Monitoring**: Monitors for suspicious system call patterns
- **Memory Analysis**: Analyzes system memory for malicious code

### Active Response
- **Automated Blocking**: Blocks IP addresses and users automatically
- **Process Termination**: Stops malicious processes when detected
- **Account Lockout**: Disables compromised user accounts
- **Custom Responses**: Configurable automated response actions

## OSSEC Architecture

### Components
1. **OSSEC Agent**: Installed on monitored hosts, collects and sends data
2. **OSSEC Manager**: Central server that receives and analyzes data
3. **OSSEC Database**: Stores events, alerts, and configuration data
4. **Web Interface**: Provides web-based management and monitoring
5. **API Interface**: REST API for integration with other systems

### Deployment Models
- **Agent/Manager**: Distributed deployment with central management
- **Local Installation**: Standalone installation on individual systems
- **Hybrid Deployment**: Combination of local and centralized monitoring

## Monitoring Capabilities

### System Logs
- **Authentication Logs**: Login attempts, privilege escalation, account changes
- **System Events**: Service starts/stops, configuration changes, errors
- **Application Logs**: Web server, database, and application-specific logs
- **Security Events**: Firewall, antivirus, and security tool logs

### File System Monitoring
- **Critical Files**: System configuration files, executables, libraries
- **User Directories**: Home directories and user-created files
- **Configuration Files**: Application and system configuration files
- **Temporary Files**: Temporary directories and cache files

### Network Monitoring
- **Connection Logs**: Network connections and traffic patterns
- **DNS Queries**: Domain name resolution requests
- **Firewall Logs**: Blocked connections and security policy violations
- **Proxy Logs**: Web proxy and content filtering logs

## Career Applications

### Security Analyst
