# IDS/IPS (Intrusion Detection System/Intrusion Prevention System)

IDS/IPS systems are security tools that monitor network traffic and system activities to detect and prevent unauthorized access, malicious activities, and security threats. IDS systems detect threats, while IPS systems can actively block them.

## How IDS/IPS Works

### Detection Methods
- **Signature-based Detection**: Matches traffic against known attack patterns
- **Anomaly-based Detection**: Identifies unusual behavior patterns
- **Behavioral Analysis**: Analyzes traffic behavior over time
- **Heuristic Analysis**: Uses rules and algorithms to detect threats

### Response Actions
- **Alert Generation**: Generate alerts for detected threats
- **Logging**: Log suspicious activities for analysis
- **Blocking**: Block malicious traffic (IPS only)
- **Rate Limiting**: Limit traffic rates for suspicious sources

### Deployment Modes
- **Inline Mode**: Traffic passes through the system (IPS)
- **Passive Mode**: Traffic is monitored without interference (IDS)
- **Tap Mode**: Traffic is copied for analysis
- **Span Port**: Traffic is mirrored for monitoring

## Types of IDS/IPS

### Network-based IDS/IPS (NIDS/NIPS)
- **Network Monitoring**: Monitor network traffic
- **Protocol Analysis**: Analyze network protocols
- **Traffic Analysis**: Analyze traffic patterns
- **Packet Inspection**: Inspect packet contents

### Host-based IDS/IPS (HIDS/HIPS)
- **System Monitoring**: Monitor system activities
- **File Integrity**: Monitor file system changes
- **Process Monitoring**: Monitor running processes
- **Registry Monitoring**: Monitor registry changes (Windows)

### Wireless IDS/IPS (WIDS/WIPS)
- **Wireless Monitoring**: Monitor wireless networks
- **Rogue AP Detection**: Detect unauthorized access points
- **Wireless Attacks**: Detect wireless-specific attacks
- **Spectrum Analysis**: Analyze wireless spectrum

## Detection Techniques

### Signature-based Detection
- **Pattern Matching**: Match traffic against known patterns
- **String Matching**: Match specific strings in traffic
- **Regular Expressions**: Use regex for pattern matching
- **Protocol Analysis**: Analyze protocol-specific patterns

### Anomaly-based Detection
- **Statistical Analysis**: Use statistical methods
- **Machine Learning**: Use ML algorithms
- **Baseline Comparison**: Compare against normal baselines
- **Threshold Monitoring**: Monitor threshold violations

### Behavioral Analysis
- **User Behavior**: Analyze user behavior patterns
- **Network Behavior**: Analyze network behavior patterns
- **Application Behavior**: Analyze application behavior
- **System Behavior**: Analyze system behavior patterns
