## What is Hashing?

**Hashing** is a one-way cryptographic function that transforms input data into a fixed-size string, called a hash or digest. It's widely used to verify integrity and store sensitive data like passwords securely.

## Key Properties

- **Deterministic** – Same input gives same output
- **Irreversible** – Cannot get original from hash
- **Collision-resistant** – Hard to find two inputs with same hash

## Best Practices

- Never store plaintext passwords — only hashed (and salted)
- Use strong algorithms like SHA-256
- Avoid outdated hashes like MD5 and SHA-1
- Don’t use hashing for encryption — it’s not reversible
