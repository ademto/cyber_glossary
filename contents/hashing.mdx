## What is Hashing?

**Hashing** is a one-way cryptographic function that transforms input data of any size into a fixed-size string, called a hash or digest. Unlike encryption, hashing is irreversible - you cannot retrieve the original data from the hash value.

## Key Properties

- **Deterministic** – Same input always produces the same output
- **Irreversible** – Cannot derive original data from the hash
- **Collision-resistant** – Extremely difficult to find two inputs that produce the same hash
- **Avalanche Effect** – Small changes in input produce completely different outputs

## Common Hash Functions

- **SHA-256** – Widely used, 256-bit output
- **SHA-3** – Latest SHA standard, more secure
- **BLAKE2** – Fast and secure alternative
- **bcrypt** – Specifically designed for password hashing
- **Argon2** – Winner of password hashing competition

## Applications

- **Password Storage** – Store hashed passwords, not plaintext
- **Data Integrity** – Verify files haven't been tampered with
- **Digital Signatures** – Part of the signing process
- **Blockchain** – Used in cryptocurrency and distributed ledgers

## Best Practices

- Use strong, modern algorithms (SHA-256, SHA-3, BLAKE2)
- Always salt passwords before hashing
- Avoid deprecated algorithms (MD5, SHA-1)
- Don't use hashing for encryption - it's not reversible
- Use specialized functions like bcrypt for password hashing
