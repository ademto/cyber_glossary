## What is Authorization?

**Authorization** defines what a user is permitted to do after their identity is authenticated. It governs access to systems, data, and features based on user roles, policies, or attributes.

## Common Models

- **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**
- **Attribute-Based Access Control (ABAC)**
- **Discretionary/ Mandatory Access Control**

## Best Practices

- Use least privilege principle
- Separate authentication and authorization logic
- Audit and log access attempts
- Review permissions periodically
