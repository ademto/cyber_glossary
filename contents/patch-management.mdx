## What is Patch Management?

**Patch Management** is a key operational process in cybersecurity. It ensures that vulnerabilities in software are addressed by keeping systems up to date with vendor-issued patches.

## Patch Cycle

1. Identify needed updates
2. Test patches in staging
3. Deploy patches in production
4. Verify successful application
5. Document and review

## Best Practices

- Prioritize critical security patches
- Test before applying to production
- Automate updates where possible
- Maintain rollback plans
