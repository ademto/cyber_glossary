# DMZ (Demilitarized Zone)

A DMZ (Demilitarized Zone) is a network segment that contains and isolates external-facing services from internal networks, providing an additional layer of security. It acts as a buffer zone between the public internet and private internal networks.

## Understanding DMZ

### Definition
A DMZ is a physical or logical subnetwork that contains and exposes an organization's external-facing services to an untrusted network, typically the internet, while keeping the internal network isolated and protected.

### Purpose
- **Service Isolation**: Isolate external-facing services
- **Attack Surface Reduction**: Reduce attack surface
- **Access Control**: Control access to external services
- **Security Layering**: Provide additional security layers

### Benefits
- **Enhanced Security**: Improved network security
- **Service Availability**: Maintain service availability
- **Access Control**: Granular access control
- **Monitoring**: Enhanced monitoring capabilities

## DMZ Architecture

### Single Firewall DMZ
- **Single Firewall**: One firewall with multiple interfaces
- **Three Zones**: Internet, DMZ, and internal network
- **Simplified Management**: Easier to manage
- **Cost Effective**: Lower cost implementation

### Dual Firewall DMZ
- **Two Firewalls**: Separate firewalls for external and internal
- **Enhanced Security**: Higher security level
- **Redundancy**: Firewall redundancy
- **Complex Management**: More complex to manage

### Multi-tier DMZ
- **Multiple Tiers**: Different security levels
- **Service Separation**: Separate different services
