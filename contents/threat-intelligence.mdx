# Threat Intelligence

Threat intelligence is the process of collecting, analyzing, and sharing information about current and emerging cyber threats. It enables organizations to anticipate, detect, and respond to attacks more effectively by understanding the tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) of threat actors.

## Types of Threat Intelligence
- **Strategic**: High-level trends and risks for executives
- **Tactical**: TTPs used by threat actors
- **Operational**: Details about specific attacks or campaigns
- **Technical**: Indicators of compromise (IOCs), malware hashes, IP addresses

## Sources of Threat Intelligence
- **Open Source Intelligence (OSINT)**: Publicly available information
- **Commercial Feeds**: Paid threat intelligence services
- **Internal Intelligence**: Data from internal monitoring and incident response
- **Information Sharing and Analysis Centers (ISACs)**: Industry-specific sharing groups

## Threat Intelligence Lifecycle
1. **Planning and Direction**: Define requirements and objectives
2. **Collection**: Gather relevant data from multiple sources
3. **Processing and Exploitation**: Organize and format data
4. **Analysis and Production**: Turn data into actionable intelligence
5. **Dissemination**: Share intelligence with stakeholders
6. **Feedback**: Refine requirements based on results

## Use Cases
- **Proactive Defense**: Anticipate and block attacks
- **Incident Response**: Investigate and remediate incidents
- **Vulnerability Management**: Prioritize patching based on threat context
- **Security Awareness**: Educate users about current threats

## Best Practices
1. **Integrate with Security Operations**: Feed intelligence into SIEM, SOAR, and IR processes
2. **Automate Collection and Analysis**: Use tools to handle large data volumes
3. **Share Intelligence**: Participate in industry sharing groups
4. **Measure Effectiveness**: Track how intelligence improves security outcomes

## Challenges
- **Data Overload**: Too much data, not enough actionable intelligence
- **False Positives**: Low-quality feeds can create noise
- **Timeliness**: Intelligence must be current to be useful

## Related Concepts
- **IOC**: Indicators of Compromise
- **Incident Response**: Using intelligence to guide response
- **State Actor**: Nation-state threats

## Conclusion

Threat intelligence is a critical component of modern cybersecurity. By understanding the threat landscape, organizations can better defend against attacks and reduce risk.
