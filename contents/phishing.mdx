## What is Phishing?

**Phishing** is a social engineering attack that uses fraudulent communications to trick users into revealing sensitive information, such as usernames, passwords, credit card details, or installing malicious software. Phishing attacks often impersonate legitimate organizations or individuals to gain the victim's trust.

## How Phishing Works

### **Attack Process**
- **Reconnaissance** – Gather information about targets
- **Bait creation** – Design convincing fake communications
- **Delivery** – Send phishing messages via email, SMS, or other channels
- **Deception** – Convince victims to take action
- **Exploitation** – Steal information or install malware

### **Common Techniques**
- **Email spoofing** – Forge sender addresses to appear legitimate
- **Website cloning** – Create fake websites that mimic real ones
- **Urgency tactics** – Create time pressure to prevent careful consideration
- **Authority impersonation** – Pretend to be from trusted sources
- **Personalization** – Use gathered information to appear credible

## Types of Phishing

### **Email Phishing**
- **Mass emails** – Sent to large numbers of recipients
- **Brand impersonation** – Pretend to be from well-known companies
- **Attachment-based** – Include malicious files
- **Link-based** – Direct users to fake websites

### **Spear Phishing**
- **Targeted attacks** – Aimed at specific individuals or organizations
- **Personalized content** – Uses gathered intelligence
- **Higher success rate** – More convincing due to personalization
- **Executive targeting** – Often targets high-level personnel

### **Whaling**
- **C-level targeting** – Attacks against executives and senior management
- **High-value targets** – Access to sensitive information and systems
- **Sophisticated tactics** – More research and preparation
- **Business email compromise** – Often involves financial fraud

## Common Phishing Scenarios

### **Credential Theft**
- **Fake login pages** – Mimic legitimate authentication systems
- **Password reset requests** – Trick users into revealing credentials
- **Account verification** – Request sensitive information under false pretenses

### **Malware Distribution**

- **Drive-by downloads** – Automatic malware installation
- **Social engineering** – Convince users to install malicious software

### **Financial Fraud**
- **Invoice scams** – Fake invoices or payment requests
- **Banking alerts** – False security notifications
- **Investment opportunities** – Fake investment schemes

## Detection and Prevention

### **Technical Controls**
- **Email filtering** – Advanced threat protection
