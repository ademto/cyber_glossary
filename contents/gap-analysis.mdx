## What is Gap Analysis?

**Gap Analysis** is a systematic process of comparing an organization's current security posture against desired standards, frameworks, or best practices to identify deficiencies, vulnerabilities, and areas for improvement. It provides a structured approach to understanding security gaps and prioritizing remediation efforts.

## Gap Analysis Process

### **Phase 1: Planning and Preparation**
- **Scope definition** – Determine analysis boundaries and objectives
- **Framework selection** – Choose relevant security frameworks
- **Stakeholder identification** – Identify key personnel and departments
- **Resource allocation** – Assign personnel and tools for analysis
- **Timeline development** – Create project schedule and milestones

### **Phase 2: Current State Assessment**
- **Documentation review** – Examine existing policies and procedures
- **Technical assessment** – Evaluate current security controls
- **Process evaluation** – Review operational security processes
- **Compliance audit** – Assess current compliance status
- **Risk evaluation** – Identify existing security risks

### **Phase 3: Desired State Definition**
- **Framework mapping** – Map requirements to chosen frameworks
- **Best practice identification** – Identify industry best practices
- **Regulatory requirements** – Document compliance requirements
- **Business objectives** – Align with organizational goals
- **Risk tolerance** – Define acceptable risk levels

### **Phase 4: Gap Identification**
- **Control comparison** – Compare current vs. desired controls
- **Process gaps** – Identify missing or inadequate processes
- **Technology gaps** – Identify missing or outdated technologies
- **Policy gaps** – Identify missing or inadequate policies
- **Compliance gaps** – Identify regulatory compliance deficiencies

### **Phase 5: Analysis and Prioritization**
- **Risk assessment** – Evaluate impact and likelihood of gaps
- **Resource analysis** – Assess required resources for remediation
- **Cost-benefit analysis** – Evaluate remediation costs vs. benefits
- **Timeline planning** – Develop remediation timeline
- **Dependency mapping** – Identify interdependencies between gaps

## Common Security Frameworks

### **NIST Cybersecurity Framework**
- **Identify** – Asset management and risk assessment
- **Protect** – Access control and data security
- **Detect** – Continuous monitoring and detection
