## What is Non-repudiation?

**Non-repudiation** is a security service that prevents individuals from denying that they performed a specific action, sent a message, or participated in a transaction. It provides irrefutable proof of the origin, integrity, and authenticity of digital communications and actions, ensuring accountability in digital environments.

## Core Principles

### **Proof of Origin**
- **Sender authentication** – Verifying who sent the message
- **Digital signatures** – Cryptographic proof of sender identity
- **Timestamp validation** – Confirming when the action occurred
- **Identity verification** – Ensuring the claimed sender is legitimate
- **Chain of custody** – Maintaining evidence integrity

### **Proof of Integrity**
- **Message integrity** – Ensuring content hasn't been altered
- **Hash verification** – Cryptographic checksums for data integrity
- **Tamper detection** – Identifying unauthorized modifications
- **Version control** – Tracking changes and modifications
- **Audit trails** – Complete record of all actions

### **Proof of Delivery**
- **Receipt confirmation** – Proof that recipient received the message
- **Delivery timestamps** – When the message was delivered
- **Read receipts** – Confirmation of message reading
- **Acknowledgment systems** – Formal acknowledgment of receipt
- **Delivery verification** – Technical proof of successful delivery

## Implementation Methods

### **Digital Signatures**
- **Public key cryptography** – Asymmetric encryption for signatures
- **Certificate authorities** – Trusted third-party verification
- **Signature algorithms** – RSA, DSA, ECDSA, EdDSA
- **Key management** – Secure key generation and storage
- **Signature verification** – Automated verification processes

### **Timestamping Services**
- **Trusted timestamping** – Third-party time verification
- **Atomic clocks** – Precise time synchronization
- **Blockchain timestamps** – Immutable time records
- **RFC 3161 compliance** – Standard timestamping protocol
- **Legal validity** – Court-admissible timestamps

### **Audit Logging**
- **Comprehensive logging** – Recording all relevant activities
- **Secure storage** – Tamper-proof log storage
- **Access controls** – Restricted log access
- **Retention policies** – Long-term log preservation
- **Forensic analysis** – Detailed activity reconstruction

## Legal and Compliance Aspects

### **Legal Admissibility**
- **Electronic signatures** – Legally binding digital signatures
- **E-SIGN Act** – US electronic signature legislation
- **eIDAS regulation** – EU electronic identification framework
- **Court acceptance** – Judicial recognition of digital evidence

### **Regulatory Compliance**
- **SOX compliance** – Sarbanes-Oxley requirements
- **GDPR requirements** – Data protection regulations
- **HIPAA standards** – Healthcare privacy requirements
- **PCI DSS** – Payment card industry standards
- **Industry regulations** – Sector-specific requirements

### **Evidence Management**
- **Chain of custody** – Maintaining evidence integrity
- **Forensic procedures** – Proper evidence handling
- **Documentation** – Complete record keeping
- **Expert analysis** – Technical evidence interpretation
- **Court presentation** – Effective evidence presentation
