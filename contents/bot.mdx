## What is a Bot (Malware)?

A **bot** is a device or system that has been compromised by malware and is remotely controlled by an attacker. Bots are typically used as part of a larger network, known as a botnet, to perform coordinated malicious activities such as DDoS attacks, spamming, or data theft.

## How Bots Work

### **Infection and Recruitment**
- **Malware infection** – Device is compromised by malicious software
- **C2 connection** – Establishes communication with a command and control server
- **Botnet enrollment** – Joins a network of other compromised devices

### **Common Bot Activities**
- **DDoS attacks** – Overwhelm targets with traffic
- **Spam distribution** – Send large volumes of unsolicited emails
- **Credential theft** – Steal usernames and passwords
- **Click fraud** – Generate fake ad clicks for revenue
- **Data exfiltration** – Steal sensitive information

## Botnet Architectures

### **Centralized Botnets**
- **Single C2 server** – All bots connect to one server
- **Easier to control** – Simple management for attackers
- **Single point of failure** – Easier to disrupt

### **Decentralized (P2P) Botnets**
- **Peer-to-peer communication** – Bots communicate with each other
- **Resilient** – Harder to take down
- **Complex management** – More difficult for attackers to control

## Detection and Prevention

### **Network Monitoring**
- **Traffic analysis** – Look for unusual outbound connections
- **Beaconing detection** – Identify regular check-ins to C2
- **Anomaly detection** – Spot abnormal device behavior

### **Endpoint Protection**
- **Antivirus software** – Detect and remove bot malware
- **EDR solutions** – Monitor for suspicious activities
- **Patch management** – Fix vulnerabilities to prevent infection

### **Organizational Measures**
- **User education** – Train users to avoid phishing and suspicious downloads
- **Incident response** – Plan for botnet infections
- **Threat intelligence** – Use feeds to identify botnet indicators

## Best Practices

- **Keep systems patched** – Regularly update software
- **Monitor network traffic** – Watch for unusual activity
- **Use strong authentication** – Prevent unauthorized access
- **Educate users** – Raise awareness of botnet threats
- **Implement incident response plans** – Prepare for botnet outbreaks
