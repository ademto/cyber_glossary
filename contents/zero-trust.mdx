# Zero Trust

Zero Trust is a cybersecurity model that eliminates the concept of trust from an organization's network architecture. Instead of assuming that everything inside the network is safe, Zero Trust requires verification of every user, device, and application before granting access to resources, regardless of their location relative to the network perimeter.

## What is Zero Trust?

Zero Trust is a security framework that operates on the principle of "never trust, always verify." It assumes that threats exist both inside and outside the network and requires continuous verification of identity, device health, and context before granting access to resources. This model moves away from traditional perimeter-based security to a more granular, identity-centric approach.

## Core Principles

### Never Trust, Always Verify
- **Continuous Authentication**: Verify identity at every access attempt
- **Device Trust**: Validate device health and compliance status
- **Context Awareness**: Consider user behavior, location, and time
- **Least Privilege**: Grant minimal access required for specific tasks

### Assume Breach
- **Threat Modeling**: Assume network is already compromised
- **Micro-segmentation**: Isolate resources and limit lateral movement
- **Continuous Monitoring**: Monitor all network activity and access
- **Incident Response**: Prepare for and respond to security incidents

### Verify Explicitly
- **Multi-factor Authentication**: Require multiple forms of verification
- **Risk-based Access**: Adjust access based on risk assessment
- **Just-in-time Access**: Grant temporary access when needed
- **Privileged Access Management**: Control elevated permissions

## Zero Trust Architecture

### Identity and Access Management
- **Single Sign-On (SSO)**: Centralized authentication across applications
- **Multi-factor Authentication (MFA)**: Multiple verification factors
- **Identity Federation**: Integration with external identity providers
- **Privileged Access Management (PAM)**: Control elevated permissions

### Device Security
- **Device Registration**: Enroll and manage all devices
- **Health Checks**: Verify device compliance and security posture
- **Endpoint Protection**: Antivirus, EDR, and security controls
- **Mobile Device Management (MDM)**: Control mobile device access

### Network Security
- **Micro-segmentation**: Divide network into smaller segments
- **Software-Defined Perimeter (SDP)**: Dynamic network boundaries
- **Network Access Control (NAC)**: Control device network access
- **Encryption**: Encrypt data in transit and at rest

### Application Security
- **Application Access Control**: Control application-level access
- **API Security**: Secure application programming interfaces
- **Container Security**: Secure containerized applications
- **Cloud Security**: Extend Zero Trust to cloud environments

## Implementation Strategy

### Assessment Phase
- **Current State Analysis**: Evaluate existing security controls
- **Gap Analysis**: Identify areas needing improvement
- **Risk Assessment**: Prioritize implementation based on risk
- **Stakeholder Buy-in**: Secure executive and business support

### Planning Phase
- **Architecture Design**: Design Zero Trust architecture
- **Technology Selection**: Choose appropriate tools and platforms
- **Implementation Roadmap**: Create phased implementation plan
- **Resource Planning**: Allocate budget and personnel

### Implementation Phase
- **Pilot Programs**: Start with limited scope implementations
- **Identity Foundation**: Establish strong identity management
- **Network Segmentation**: Implement micro-segmentation
- **Monitoring and Analytics**: Deploy comprehensive monitoring

### Optimization Phase
- **Performance Tuning**: Optimize for user experience
- **Policy Refinement**: Adjust policies based on usage patterns
- **Continuous Improvement**: Regular assessment and updates
