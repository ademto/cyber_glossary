## What is Zero Trust?

**Zero Trust** is a security framework that eliminates implicit trust and continuously validates every stage of digital interactions. It operates on the principle of "never trust, always verify" regardless of network location.

## Core Principles

- **Verify Explicitly** – Authenticate and authorize every request
- **Use Least Privilege** – Grant minimal access necessary
- **Assume Breach** – Design for potential compromise
- **Micro-segmentation** – Segment networks into small zones

## Implementation Strategy

- Start with identity and access management
- Implement network segmentation
- Deploy continuous monitoring
- Apply to all resources and users
