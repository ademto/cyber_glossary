## What is Zero Trust?

**Zero Trust** is a modern security framework that assumes every user and device is potentially compromised. It enforces strict verification regardless of whether access is from inside or outside the network perimeter.

## Pillars of Zero Trust

- Verify identity continuously
- Validate device posture
- Limit access using least privilege
- Use microsegmentation
- Monitor and log all activity

## Best Practices

- Adopt identity-first strategies
- Integrate with SIEM and EDR tools
- Enforce device compliance
- Start with high-value assets
