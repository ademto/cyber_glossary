## What is a Keylogger?

A **keylogger** is a type of malware or hardware device that records every keystroke made on a computer or mobile device. Keyloggers are used by attackers to capture sensitive information such as passwords, credit card numbers, and private messages.

## How Keyloggers Work

### **Software Keyloggers**
- **Process injection** – Injects code into legitimate processes
- **API hooking** – Intercepts keystrokes at the operating system level
- **Browser extensions** – Captures input from web browsers
- **Remote access** – Sends captured data to attackers

### **Hardware Keyloggers**
- **Physical devices** – Placed between keyboard and computer
- **Wireless keyloggers** – Capture keystrokes from wireless keyboards
- **Mobile keyloggers** – Installed on smartphones and tablets

## Detection and Prevention

- **Antivirus/anti-spyware** – Use reputable security software
- **Behavioral monitoring** – Watch for suspicious activity
- **Physical inspection** – Check for unauthorized hardware
- **Patch management** – Keep systems updated
- **User education** – Avoid suspicious downloads and links

## Removal and Response

- **Quarantine and remove** – Use security tools to remove software keyloggers
- **Physical removal** – Inspect and remove hardware devices
- **Change passwords** – After removal, update all credentials
- **Monitor accounts** – Watch for unauthorized activity

## Best Practices

- **Download from trusted sources** – Avoid third-party sites
- **Regularly update software** – Patch vulnerabilities
- **Use strong authentication** – Protect sensitive accounts
- **Educate users** – Raise awareness of keylogger risks
- **Implement incident response plans** – Prepare for keylogger incidents
