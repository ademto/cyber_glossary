# STRIDE

STRIDE is a threat modeling framework developed by Microsoft that categorizes security threats into six distinct categories. It provides a systematic approach to identifying and analyzing potential security threats during the design and development of software applications and systems.

## STRIDE Categories

### S - Spoofing
- **Definition**: Impersonating another user or system
- **Examples**: Email spoofing, IP spoofing, session hijacking
- **Mitigation**: Strong authentication, digital certificates, session management

### T - Tampering
- **Definition**: Unauthorized modification of data or code
- **Examples**: Data manipulation, code injection, configuration changes
- **Mitigation**: Input validation, integrity checks, access controls

### R - Repudiation
- **Definition**: Denying responsibility for actions
- **Examples**: Log deletion, transaction denial, audit trail manipulation
- **Mitigation**: Comprehensive logging, digital signatures, audit trails

### I - Information Disclosure
- **Definition**: Unauthorized access to sensitive information
- **Examples**: Data breaches, information leakage, error messages
- **Mitigation**: Encryption, access controls, secure error handling

### D - Denial of Service
- **Definition**: Preventing legitimate users from accessing services
- **Examples**: DDoS attacks, resource exhaustion, service degradation
- **Mitigation**: Rate limiting, resource monitoring, redundancy

### E - Elevation of Privilege
- **Definition**: Gaining unauthorized access to higher privileges
- **Examples**: Privilege escalation, admin access, root compromise
- **Mitigation**: Least privilege, access controls, privilege separation

## STRIDE Process
1. **Asset Identification**: Identify valuable assets and data
2. **Threat Categorization**: Apply STRIDE categories to each component
3. **Threat Analysis**: Analyze likelihood and impact of each threat
4. **Mitigation Planning**: Design controls to address identified threats
5. **Validation**: Verify that mitigations effectively address threats

## Benefits
- **Systematic Approach**: Structured method for threat identification
- **Comprehensive Coverage**: Addresses all major threat categories
- **Early Detection**: Identifies threats during design phase
- **Cost Effective**: Reduces security issues before implementation

## Best Practices
1. **Early Integration**: Include STRIDE in design phase
2. **Regular Updates**: Update threat models as systems evolve
3. **Team Involvement**: Include security, development, and operations teams
4. **Documentation**: Maintain detailed threat model documentation

## Tools
- **Microsoft Threat Modeling Tool**: Official STRIDE implementation
- **OWASP Threat Dragon**: Open-source threat modeling tool
- **Custom Templates**: Organization-specific threat modeling templates

## Related Concepts
- **Threat Modeling**: Systematic threat identification
- **Attack Surface**: Points of potential attack
- **Security Architecture**: Secure system design

## Conclusion

STRIDE provides a valuable framework for systematic threat identification and analysis. When properly implemented, it helps organizations build more secure systems by identifying and addressing threats early in the development lifecycle.
