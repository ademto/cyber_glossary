## What is Vulnerability Assessment?

**Vulnerability Assessment** is a systematic approach to identifying security weaknesses in systems, networks, and applications. It helps organizations understand their security posture and prioritize remediation efforts.

## Assessment Types

- **Automated Scanning** – Using tools to identify known vulnerabilities
- **Manual Testing** – Human-driven analysis of security controls
- **Hybrid Approach** – Combining automated and manual methods
- **Continuous Assessment** – Ongoing monitoring and testing

## Best Practices

- Conduct assessments regularly
- Use multiple assessment tools
- Prioritize vulnerabilities by risk
- Document findings and remediation steps
- Follow up on remediation efforts
