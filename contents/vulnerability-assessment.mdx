## What is Vulnerability Assessment?

A **Vulnerability Assessment** scans systems and networks for known weaknesses. Unlike penetration testing, it does not exploit vulnerabilitiesâ€”it only identifies them so they can be fixed proactively.

## Steps in the Process

1. Define scope
2. Run automated scans
3. Analyze findings
4. Assign severity
5. Recommend remediation

## Best Practices

- Schedule regular assessments
- Patch high-risk findings promptly
- Combine with manual verification
- Use CVSS scores to prioritize fixes
