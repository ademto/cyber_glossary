## What is a DDoS Attack?

A **Distributed Denial-of-Service (DDoS) attack** floods a target system or network with excessive traffic, rendering services slow or unavailable. Attackers often use botnets made up of compromised devices.

## Types of DDoS Attacks

- **Volumetric** – Massive traffic to consume bandwidth
- **Protocol-based** – Exploits weaknesses in layer protocols
- **Application-layer** – Targets specific app functions

## Best Practices

- Use DDoS protection services (e.g., Cloudflare, AWS Shield)
- Monitor network traffic patterns
- Rate-limit incoming requests
- Set up auto-scaling for high availability
