## What is Vulnerability Scanning?

**Vulnerability scanning** is the automated process of identifying security vulnerabilities in systems, networks, and applications. It involves using specialized tools to systematically check for known security weaknesses, misconfigurations, and potential attack vectors to assess an organization's security posture.

## Types of Vulnerability Scans

### **Network Vulnerability Scans**
- **Port scanning** – Identify open ports and services
- **Service enumeration** – Discover running services and versions
- **OS fingerprinting** – Determine operating system types
- **Network mapping** – Map network topology and devices
- **Configuration analysis** – Check network device configurations

### **Web Application Scans**
- **SQL injection testing** – Check for database vulnerabilities
- **Cross-site scripting** – Test for XSS vulnerabilities
- **Authentication testing** – Verify authentication mechanisms
- **Session management** – Check session handling security
- **Input validation** – Test input handling and validation

### **Database Scans**
- **Configuration review** – Check database security settings
- **User permissions** – Review user access and privileges
- **Patch levels** – Verify database software versions
- **Encryption settings** – Check data encryption configurations
- **Backup security** – Review backup and recovery procedures

## Scan Types and Methods

### **Credentialed vs. Non-Credentialed**
- **Credentialed scans** – Use valid user credentials for deeper access
- **Non-credentialed scans** – External scans without authentication
- **Privileged scans** – Use administrative credentials
- **Limited scans** – Use restricted user accounts

### **Intrusive vs. Non-Intrusive**
- **Non-intrusive scans** – Passive scanning without system impact
- **Intrusive scans** – Active testing that may affect systems
- **Proof-of-concept testing** – Validate vulnerability existence
- **Safe exploitation** – Controlled vulnerability verification

### **Scan Frequency**
- **Scheduled scans** – Regular automated scanning
- **On-demand scans** – Manual scanning as needed
- **Continuous monitoring** – Real-time vulnerability assessment
- **Post-change scans** – Scanning after system modifications

## Common Vulnerability Categories

### **Technical Vulnerabilities**
- **Buffer overflows** – Memory management vulnerabilities
- **SQL injection** – Database query vulnerabilities
- **Cross-site scripting** – Web application vulnerabilities
- **Privilege escalation** – Access control vulnerabilities
- **Weak encryption** – Cryptographic vulnerabilities

### **Configuration Vulnerabilities**
- **Default passwords** – Unchanged default credentials
- **Open ports** – Unnecessary open network ports
- **Weak authentication** – Inadequate authentication mechanisms
- **Missing patches** – Unpatched software vulnerabilities
- **Insecure protocols** – Use of deprecated security protocols

## False Positives and Negatives

### **False Positives**
- **Misidentified vulnerabilities** – Tools incorrectly flag issues
- **Environmental factors** – Context-specific false alarms
- **Tool limitations** – Scanner capability constraints
- **Configuration issues** – Scanner misconfiguration
- **Version mismatches** – Tool version compatibility issues

### **False Negatives**
- **Missed vulnerabilities** – Tools fail to detect real issues
- **Zero-day vulnerabilities** – Unknown vulnerabilities
- **Custom applications** – Proprietary software vulnerabilities
- **Complex attack vectors** – Sophisticated attack methods
- **Tool limitations** – Scanner capability gaps

## Best Practices

### **Scanning Strategy**
- **Comprehensive coverage** – Scan all systems and applications
- **Regular scheduling** – Establish consistent scan schedules
- **Risk-based prioritization** – Focus on high-risk systems
- **Documentation** – Maintain detailed scan records
- **Validation** – Verify scan results through manual testing

### **Tool Management**
- **Multiple tools** – Use different scanning tools
- **Regular updates** – Keep scanning tools current
- **Customization** – Configure tools for specific environments
- **Integration** – Integrate with security management systems
- **Performance monitoring** – Monitor scan performance and impact

### **Response and Remediation**
- **Prioritization** – Rank vulnerabilities by severity
- **Timeline management** – Establish remediation timelines
- **Verification** – Confirm vulnerability remediation
- **Reporting** – Generate comprehensive vulnerability reports
- **Trend analysis** – Track vulnerability trends over time
