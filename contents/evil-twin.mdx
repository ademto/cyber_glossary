## What is an Evil Twin Attack?

An **Evil Twin** is a wireless network attack where an attacker creates a fake Wi-Fi access point that appears to be a legitimate network. The fake access point typically has a stronger signal than the legitimate one, causing users to connect to it instead, allowing the attacker to intercept and monitor all network traffic.

## How Evil Twin Attacks Work

### **Attack Setup**
- **Network reconnaissance** – Identify target networks and their characteristics
- **Fake AP creation** – Set up malicious access point with same SSID
- **Signal amplification** – Use stronger signal to attract users
- **Traffic interception** – Monitor and capture all network traffic
- **Data extraction** – Extract sensitive information from captured traffic

### **Common Techniques**
- **SSID spoofing** – Use identical network name
- **Signal jamming** – Disrupt legitimate network signal
- **Deauthentication attacks** – Force users to disconnect and reconnect
- **Captive portal** – Create fake login page
- **SSL stripping** – Remove encryption from HTTPS traffic

## Types of Evil Twin Attacks

### **Passive Monitoring**
- **Traffic analysis** – Monitor network traffic without modification
- **Packet capture** – Capture and analyze data packets
- **Session hijacking** – Steal active sessions
- **Credential harvesting** – Collect login credentials

### **Active Interference**
- **Traffic modification** – Alter network traffic
- **DNS poisoning** – Redirect DNS queries
- **ARP spoofing** – Manipulate ARP tables
- **SSL certificate spoofing** – Present fake certificates

### **Advanced Techniques**
- **KARMA attacks** – Respond to probe requests
- **MANA attacks** – Manipulate network announcements
- **Known beacon attacks** – Exploit saved network preferences
- **Wi-Fi Pineapple** – Use specialized hardware for attacks

## Detection and Prevention

### **Technical Controls**
- **VPN usage** – Encrypt all traffic through VPN
- **Certificate validation** – Verify SSL certificates
- **Network monitoring** – Monitor for duplicate SSIDs
- **Signal strength analysis** – Detect unusual signal patterns
- **MAC address filtering** – Restrict access to known devices

### **User Education**
- **Security awareness** – Educate users about risks
- **Connection verification** – Verify network authenticity
- **Avoid public Wi-Fi** – Use mobile hotspots when possible
- **Disable auto-connect** – Prevent automatic connections
- **Network preferences** – Remove saved public networks

### **Organizational Measures**
- **Wireless security policies** – Clear guidelines for wireless usage
- **Network monitoring** – Monitor for rogue access points
- **Incident response** – Prepare for evil twin incidents
- **Regular audits** – Review wireless security measures

## Response and Recovery

### **Immediate Actions**
- **Disconnect immediately** – Remove device from network
- **Change passwords** – Update all account credentials
- **Monitor accounts** – Watch for unauthorized activity
- **Report incident** – Notify security teams

### **Investigation Steps**
- **Network analysis** – Examine network traffic logs
- **Device forensics** – Analyze affected devices
- **Impact assessment** – Determine scope of compromise
- **Corrective actions** – Implement improved security measures

## Best Practices

- **Use VPN connections** – Encrypt all wireless traffic
- **Verify network authenticity** – Confirm legitimate networks
- **Avoid sensitive transactions** – Don't use public Wi-Fi for banking
- **Keep devices updated** – Regular security updates
- **Use mobile hotspots** – Personal hotspots when possible
- **Monitor for suspicious activity** – Watch for unusual network behavior
