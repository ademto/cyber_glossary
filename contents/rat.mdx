## What is a Remote Access Trojan (RAT)?

A **Remote Access Trojan (RAT)** is a type of Trojan malware that allows attackers to remotely control infected systems. RATs are used for surveillance, data theft, espionage, and maintaining persistent access to compromised networks.

## How RATs Work

### **Infection Methods**
- **Phishing emails** – Malicious attachments or links
- **Malicious downloads** – Bundled with pirated or fake software
- **Software vulnerabilities** – Exploits in legitimate applications
- **Drive-by downloads** – Automatic downloads from compromised websites

### **Capabilities**
- **Remote desktop control** – Full access to the victim's system
- **File transfer** – Upload and download files
- **Keylogging** – Record keystrokes
- **Screen capture** – Take screenshots
- **Webcam/microphone access** – Spy on users
- **Credential theft** – Steal usernames and passwords
- **Persistence mechanisms** – Survive reboots and detection

## Detection and Prevention

- **Antivirus/EDR** – Use reputable security software
- **Network monitoring** – Watch for suspicious outbound connections
- **Patch management** – Keep systems updated
- **User education** – Avoid suspicious downloads and links
- **Application whitelisting** – Only allow approved software

## Response and Removal

- **Isolate infected systems** – Prevent further compromise
- **Quarantine and remove** – Use security tools to remove RATs
- **Change passwords** – After removal, update all credentials
- **Monitor for persistence** – Check for backdoors and scheduled tasks
- **Forensic analysis** – Investigate the extent of compromise

## Best Practices

- **Download from trusted sources** – Avoid third-party sites
- **Regularly update software** – Patch vulnerabilities
- **Use strong authentication** – Protect sensitive accounts
- **Educate users** – Raise awareness of RAT risks
- **Implement incident response plans** – Prepare for RAT incidents
