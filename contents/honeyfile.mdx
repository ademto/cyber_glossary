## What is a Honeyfile?

**A Honeyfile** is a decoy file designed to attract and detect unauthorized access or data exfiltration attempts. These files appear to contain valuable or sensitive information but are actually monitored to trigger alerts when accessed, providing early warning of data breaches, insider threats, and unauthorized data access.

## Honeyfile Types and Categories

### **Document Honeyfiles**
- **Financial documents** – Fake financial reports and budgets
- **Legal documents** – Decoy legal contracts and agreements
- **HR documents** – Fake employee records and salary information
- **Technical documents** – Decoy technical specifications and designs
- **Strategic documents** – Fake business plans and strategies

### **Database Honeyfiles**
- **Customer records** – Fake customer data and information
- **Product data** – Decoy product specifications and pricing
- **Employee data** – Fake employee records and personal information
- **Financial data** – Decoy financial records and transactions
- **Configuration data** – Fake system configurations and settings

### **Credential Honeyfiles**
- **Login credentials** – Fake username and password combinations
- **API keys** – Decoy application programming interface keys
- **Database credentials** – Fake database connection strings
- **SSH keys** – Decoy secure shell keys
- **Certificate files** – Fake digital certificates

### **Sensitive Data Honeyfiles**
- **Personal information** – Fake personally identifiable information
- **Medical records** – Decoy health information
- **Credit card data** – Fake payment card information
- **Intellectual property** – Decoy trade secrets and patents
- **Source code** – Fake application source code
