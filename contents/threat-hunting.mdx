# Threat Hunting

Threat Hunting is a proactive cybersecurity approach where security analysts actively search for threats and malicious activity that may have evaded existing security controls, using hypothesis-driven investigation and advanced analytics.

## Understanding Threat Hunting

### Definition
Threat Hunting is a proactive and iterative approach to cybersecurity that involves actively searching for, identifying, and responding to threats that may have evaded existing security controls.
