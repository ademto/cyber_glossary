# Suricata

Suricata is a high-performance, open-source network threat detection engine that provides intrusion detection (IDS), intrusion prevention (IPS), network security monitoring (NSM), and offline pcap processing capabilities. Developed by the Open Information Security Foundation (OISF), Suricata is designed to handle high-speed networks and provide comprehensive security monitoring.

## What is Suricata?

Suricata is a next-generation network security monitoring engine that combines the capabilities of traditional IDS/IPS systems with advanced features for threat hunting and network forensics. It uses multi-threading and hardware acceleration to process network traffic at high speeds while maintaining accuracy and providing detailed analysis.

## Key Features

### High-Performance Engine
- Multi-threaded architecture for parallel processing
- Hardware acceleration support (FPGA, GPU, DPDK)
- Capable of processing traffic at 10+ Gbps speeds
- Efficient memory usage and resource management

### Network Security Monitoring (NSM)
- Full packet capture and storage
- Protocol analysis and anomaly detection
- File extraction and analysis capabilities
- Network flow tracking and analysis

### Advanced Detection Capabilities
- Signature-based detection with custom rules
- Anomaly-based detection using statistical analysis
- Protocol anomaly detection
- File type identification and analysis

### File Analysis
- Automatic file extraction from network traffic
- File type identification and validation
- Integration with antivirus and sandbox solutions
- File hash calculation and reputation checking

## Suricata Architecture

### Core Components
1. **Capture Engine**: Handles packet capture from various interfaces
2. **Decode Engine**: Parses and normalizes network protocols
3. **Detection Engine**: Applies rules and performs analysis
4. **Output Engine**: Handles logging, alerting, and data export
5. **Management Interface**: Provides configuration and monitoring

### Operating Modes
- **IDS Mode**: Passive monitoring and alerting
- **IPS Mode**: Active blocking and prevention
- **NSM Mode**: Full packet capture and analysis
- **Offline Mode**: Analysis of stored pcap files

## Rule Language

Suricata uses a rule language similar to Snort but with additional features:

```
alert tcp $EXTERNAL_NET any -> $HOME_NET 22 (msg:"SSH brute force attempt"; flow:established; content:"SSH"; nocase; threshold:type threshold, track by_src, count 5, seconds 60; sid:1000001; rev:1;)
```

### Advanced Rule Features
- **HTTP Keywords**: Specific HTTP protocol analysis
- **SSL/TLS Keywords**: Encrypted traffic analysis
- **File Keywords**: File type and content analysis
- **Flow Keywords**: Connection state and direction analysis

## Deployment Strategies

### Network-Based Deployment
- **Inline IPS**: Active blocking of malicious traffic
- **Passive IDS**: Monitoring without traffic modification
- **TAP/SPAN**: Monitoring mirrored network traffic
- **Load Balancing**: Distributed deployment across multiple sensors

### Cloud and Virtual Environments
- **Container Deployment**: Docker and Kubernetes integration
- **Cloud-Native**: AWS, Azure, and GCP deployment options
- **Virtual Appliances**: Pre-configured virtual machines
- **Hybrid Deployments**: On-premises and cloud integration

### High-Availability Setup
- **Failover Configuration**: Redundant sensor deployment
- **Load Distribution**: Traffic splitting across multiple sensors
- **Centralized Management**: Unified configuration and monitoring
- **Scalable Architecture**: Horizontal scaling capabilities
