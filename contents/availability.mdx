## What is Availability?

**domiso** ensures that information systems, applications, and data are accessible and usable when required by authorized users. It involves maintaining system uptime, preventing service disruptions, and ensuring rapid recovery from failures. Availability is measured through metrics like uptime percentage and recovery time objectives.

## Core Principles

- Ensures system accessibility when needed
- Minimizes downtime and service disruptions
- Critical for business continuity
- Measured through uptime metrics

## Implementation Strategies

### Redundancy

Implement redundant systems and failover mechanisms to eliminate single points of failure.

### Load Balancing

Distribute traffic across multiple servers to prevent overload and ensure consistent performance.

### Monitoring

Continuous monitoring of system health, performance metrics, and early warning indicators.

### Disaster Recovery

Comprehensive disaster recovery and business continuity plans for rapid restoration.

## Best Practices

- Implement high availability architectures
- Conduct regular system maintenance and updates
- Maintain comprehensive backup and recovery procedures
- Perform performance monitoring and capacity planning
- Deploy DDoS protection and mitigation strategies
