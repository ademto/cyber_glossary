# Availability

Availability is one of the three fundamental principles of information security, along with Confidentiality and Integrity (collectively known as the CIA triad). It ensures that systems, data, and services are accessible and usable when needed by authorized users, protecting against service disruptions and downtime.

## Understanding Availability

### Definition
Availability refers to the ability of authorized users to access information, systems, and services when needed. It ensures that resources are operational and accessible within acceptable timeframes and performance levels.

### Importance
- **Business Continuity**: Essential for maintaining business operations
- **Customer Service**: Ensures customer access to services
- **Revenue Protection**: Protects against revenue loss from downtime
- **Compliance**: Required by various regulations and service level agreements

### Metrics
- **Uptime**: Percentage of time systems are operational
- **Response Time**: Time to respond to user requests
- **Throughput**: Amount of work completed in a given time
- **Recovery Time**: Time to restore services after failure

## Availability Threats

### Natural Disasters
- **Earthquakes**: Physical damage to infrastructure
- **Floods**: Water damage to equipment
- **Hurricanes**: Wind and water damage
- **Fires**: Destruction of facilities and equipment

### Technical Failures
- **Hardware Failures**: Component failures in systems
- **Software Failures**: Application crashes and bugs
- **Network Failures**: Network connectivity issues
- **Power Failures**: Electrical power disruptions

### Human Errors
- **Configuration Errors**: Incorrect system configurations
- **Operator Errors**: Mistakes by system operators
- **Maintenance Errors**: Errors during system maintenance
- **Training Deficiencies**: Lack of proper training

### Malicious Attacks
- **Denial of Service (DoS)**: Overwhelming systems with traffic
- **Distributed DoS (DDoS)**: Coordinated attack from multiple sources
- **Ransomware**: Encrypting data and demanding payment
- **Sabotage**: Intentional damage to systems

## Availability Controls

### Preventive Controls
- **Redundancy**: Duplicate critical components
- **Failover Systems**: Automatic switching to backup systems
- **Load Balancing**: Distribute load across multiple systems
- **Regular Maintenance**: Preventative maintenance schedules

### Detective Controls
- **Monitoring Systems**: Monitor system health and performance
- **Alerting**: Alert administrators to issues
- **Logging**: Log system events and errors
- **Health Checks**: Regular system health checks

### Corrective Controls
- **Backup Systems**: Restore from backups
- **Disaster Recovery**: Recover from disasters
- **Incident Response**: Respond to availability incidents
- **Service Restoration**: Restore services quickly

## High Availability (HA)

### HA Architecture
- **Active-Active**: Multiple systems running simultaneously
- **Active-Passive**: Primary system with standby backup
- **Clustering**: Multiple systems working together
- **Load Balancing**: Distribute load across systems

### HA Components
- **Redundant Hardware**: Duplicate hardware components
- **Redundant Networks**: Multiple network paths
- **Redundant Storage**: Multiple storage systems
- **Redundant Power**: Multiple power sources

### HA Technologies
- **Virtualization**: Virtual machine high availability
- **Container Orchestration**: Kubernetes and Docker Swarm
- **Database Clustering**: Database high availability
- **Application Clustering**: Application-level high availability

## Disaster Recovery (DR)

### DR Planning
- **Business Impact Analysis**: Assess impact of disasters
- **Recovery Objectives**: Define recovery time and point objectives
- **Recovery Strategies**: Develop recovery strategies
- **Testing**: Test disaster recovery procedures

### DR Strategies
- **Backup and Restore**: Traditional backup and restore
