## What is File Integrity Monitoring?

**File Integrity Monitoring (FIM)** is a security technology that continuously monitors and detects unauthorized changes to critical files, system configurations, and application binaries. FIM provides early warning of potential security breaches by establishing baselines and alerting when files are modified, created, or deleted.

## FIM Core Concepts

### **Integrity Monitoring**
- **File integrity** – Ensuring files remain unchanged from baseline
- **System integrity** – Maintaining system configuration integrity
- **Application integrity** – Protecting application binaries and libraries
- **Configuration integrity** – Monitoring configuration file changes
- **Registry integrity** – Windows registry monitoring

### **Baseline Establishment**
- **Initial baseline** – Establish initial file state baseline
- **Hash calculation** – Calculate cryptographic hashes of files
- **Metadata capture** – Capture file metadata and attributes
- **Configuration baseline** – Establish system configuration baseline
- **Regular updates** – Update baselines as needed

### **Change Detection**
- **Hash comparison** – Compare current hashes with baseline
- **Metadata comparison** – Compare file metadata changes
- **Size monitoring** – Monitor file size changes
- **Timestamp monitoring** – Monitor modification timestamps
- **Permission monitoring** – Monitor file permission changes

## FIM Implementation Methods

### **Hash-Based Monitoring**
- **Cryptographic hashes** – SHA-256, SHA-3, MD5 (legacy)
- **Hash calculation** – Calculate hashes of monitored files
- **Hash comparison** – Compare current vs. baseline hashes
- **Hash storage** – Secure storage of baseline hashes
- **Hash verification** – Regular hash verification

### **Real-Time Monitoring**
- **File system events** – Monitor file system events
- **Change notifications** – Real-time change notifications

### **Periodic Scanning**
- **Scheduled scans** – Regular scheduled integrity checks
- **Full system scans** – Complete system integrity verification
- **Incremental scans** – Scan only changed files
- **Differential analysis** – Analyze differences from baseline
- **Report generation** – Generate integrity reports
