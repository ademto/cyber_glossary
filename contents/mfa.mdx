## What is MFA?

**Multi-Factor Authentication** strengthens account security by requiring users to present two or more verification factors. Even if one factor (like a password) is compromised, an attacker still can't access the system without the others.

## MFA Factors

1. **Something you know** – Password, PIN
2. **Something you have** – Phone, token
3. **Something you are** – Biometric traits

## Best Practices

- Combine different types of factors
- Use app-based authenticators over SMS when possible
- Enforce MFA for all admin and sensitive access
- Monitor for MFA fatigue attacks
