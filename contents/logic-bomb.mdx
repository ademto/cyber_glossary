## What is a Logic Bomb?

A **logic bomb** is a piece of malicious code that is intentionally inserted into a software system and set to execute when certain conditions are met, such as a specific date, the deletion of a user account, or the launch of a particular program. Logic bombs are often used to cause harm, disrupt operations, or delete data.

## How Logic Bombs Work

### **Trigger Mechanisms**
- **Date/time** – Executes on a specific date or time
- **User action** – Triggered by a particular user activity
- **System event** – Activated by system changes or failures
- **File modification** – Runs when a file is changed or deleted

### **Common Payloads**
- **Data deletion** – Erases files or databases
- **System corruption** – Damages operating systems or applications
- **Disabling security** – Turns off security controls
- **Launching other malware** – Triggers additional attacks

## Detection and Prevention

- **Code review** – Regularly review source code for suspicious logic
- **Behavioral monitoring** – Watch for unusual system activity
- **Access controls** – Limit permissions to critical systems
- **Separation of duties** – Prevent single-user sabotage
- **Incident response** – Prepare for insider threats

## Famous Examples

- **Tim Lloyd (Omega Engineering, 1996)** – Logic bomb deleted critical files, causing $10 million in damages
- **Sony BMG (2005)** – Rootkit logic bomb disabled CD copying

## Best Practices

- **Enforce least privilege** – Limit user access
- **Monitor for changes** – Track modifications to critical systems
- **Conduct regular audits** – Review code and system activity
- **Educate employees** – Raise awareness of insider threats
- **Implement incident response plans** – Prepare for logic bomb incidents
