## What is Integrity?

**Integrity** ensures that data and systems remain accurate, complete, and unaltered by unauthorized parties. It involves protecting information from being modified, deleted, or corrupted in unauthorized ways. Integrity is maintained through checksums, digital signatures, version control, and access controls.

## Key Components

- Ensures data accuracy and completeness
- Prevents unauthorized modifications
- Maintains system reliability
- Critical for decision-making processes

## Implementation Methods

### Hash Functions

Use cryptographic hashes like SHA-256 to verify data integrity and detect unauthorized changes.

### Digital Signatures

Implement digital signatures to provide authentication and non-repudiation for critical documents.

### Version Control

Maintain detailed logs of all data changes with timestamps and user identification.

### Backup Systems

Regular backups enable restoration of data if integrity is compromised.

## Best Practices

- Implement checksums for data verification
- Use digital signatures for critical documents
- Conduct regular integrity checks and audits
- Maintain comprehensive audit logs
- Implement robust change management processes
