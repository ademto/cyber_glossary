## What is Threat Modeling?

**Threat Modeling** helps teams proactively identify where a system could be attacked and plan countermeasures. It’s typically done during the design phase but can be revisited continuously.

## Key Steps

- Identify assets and users
- Define system architecture
- List threats and vulnerabilities
- Prioritize risks
- Document and fix weaknesses

## Best Practices

- Involve cross-functional teams
- Model early and update often
- Choose a methodology that suits the project
- Don’t just list — mitigate
