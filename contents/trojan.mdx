## What is a Trojan?

A **Trojan** (or Trojan Horse) is malicious software that disguises itself as legitimate, useful software to trick users into downloading and executing it. Unlike viruses and worms, Trojans don't self-replicate but rely on social engineering to spread.

## How Trojans Work

### **Infection Process**
- **Disguise** – Masquerades as legitimate software (games, utilities, documents)
- **Distribution** – Spread through email attachments, downloads, USB drives
- **Execution** – User unknowingly runs the malicious code
- **Installation** – Establishes persistence and hides from detection

### **Common Disguises**
- **Fake software updates** – Mimics legitimate update notifications
- **Cracked software** – Promises free versions of paid software
- **Document files** – Malicious macros in Word/Excel files
- **Mobile apps** – Fake versions of popular applications

## Types of Trojans

### **Remote Access Trojans (RATs)**
- **Backdoor access** – Provides remote control of infected systems
- **Keylogging** – Captures keystrokes and passwords
- **Screen capture** – Records user activity
- **File manipulation** – Upload, download, delete files

### **Banking Trojans**
- **Form grabbing** – Captures banking credentials
- **Web injection** – Modifies banking websites
- **Session hijacking** – Steals active banking sessions
- **SMS interception** – Captures 2FA codes

### **Downloader Trojans**
- **Secondary payload** – Downloads additional malware
- **Update mechanism** – Receives new malicious code
- **Modular design** – Can add new capabilities remotely

### **DDoS Trojans**
- **Botnet recruitment** – Enlists systems in attack networks
- **Traffic generation** – Floods targets with requests
- **Distributed attacks** – Coordinates multiple infected systems

## Detection and Prevention

### **Technical Detection**
- **Behavioral analysis** – Monitor for suspicious activities
- **Sandboxing** – Execute in isolated environments
- **Signature detection** – Known malware patterns
- **Heuristic analysis** – Suspicious code patterns

### **Prevention Strategies**
- **User education** – Security awareness training
- **Email filtering** – Block malicious attachments
- **Web filtering** – Prevent access to malicious sites
- **Application whitelisting** – Only allow approved software
- **Regular updates** – Keep systems and software patched

## Analysis and Response

### **Static Analysis**
- **File examination** – Analyze without execution
- **String analysis** – Extract readable text and URLs
- **PE analysis** – Examine executable structure
- **Hash comparison** – Check against known malware databases

### **Dynamic Analysis**
- **Sandbox execution** – Monitor behavior in safe environment
- **Network monitoring** – Track communication attempts
- **Registry monitoring** – Watch for persistence mechanisms
- **File system monitoring** – Track file creation and modification

## Best Practices

- **Verify software sources** – Download from official websites
- **Use antivirus software** – Keep definitions updated
- **Enable UAC** – User Account Control on Windows
- **Regular backups** – Protect against data loss
- **Network monitoring** – Detect unusual traffic patterns
- **Incident response plan** – Prepare for infections
