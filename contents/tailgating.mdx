## What is Tailgating?

**Tailgating** is a physical security attack where unauthorized individuals gain access to restricted areas by following authorized personnel through secure entrances such as doors, gates, or turnstiles. This attack exploits human nature and social engineering to bypass physical security controls.

## How Tailgating Works

### **Attack Methods**
- **Following closely** – Walk directly behind authorized personnel
- **Holding doors** – Pretend to be helpful by holding doors open
- **Carrying items** – Appear to be carrying legitimate items
- **Social engineering** – Use conversation to gain trust
- **Distraction techniques** – Create distractions to slip through

### **Common Scenarios**
- **Office buildings** – Following employees through secure entrances
- **Data centers** – Gaining access to server rooms
- **Manufacturing facilities** – Accessing production areas
- **Government buildings** – Entering restricted government facilities
- **Healthcare facilities** – Accessing patient care areas

## Types of Tailgating Attacks

### **Opportunistic Tailgating**
- **Spontaneous attacks** – Take advantage of opportunities
- **Low planning** – Minimal preparation required
- **High success rate** – Often successful due to human nature
- **Multiple targets** – Can target various locations

### **Planned Tailgating**
- **Reconnaissance** – Study target locations and patterns
- **Social engineering** – Develop personas and pretexts
- **Timing analysis** – Choose optimal times for attacks
- **Multiple attempts** – Persistent efforts to gain access

### **Insider-Assisted Tailgating**
- **Employee cooperation** – Authorized personnel assist attackers
- **Social pressure** – Exploit social relationships
- **Authority exploitation** – Use perceived authority
- **Bribery or coercion** – Compromise authorized personnel

## Detection and Prevention

### **Physical Security Measures**
- **Access control systems** – Card readers, biometric scanners
- **Turnstiles and gates** – Physical barriers to prevent tailgating
- **Security personnel** – Human monitoring and intervention
- **Surveillance cameras** – Video monitoring and recording
- **Alarm systems** – Door alarms and motion sensors

### **Procedural Controls**
- **Security policies** – Clear guidelines for access control
- **Employee training** – Security awareness education
- **Visitor management** – Proper visitor registration and escorting
- **Incident reporting** – Report suspicious activity
- **Regular audits** – Review access control effectiveness

### **Technical Controls**
- **Access logs** – Record all access attempts
- **Video analytics** – Automated detection of tailgating
- **Integration systems** – Connect physical and logical security
- **Real-time monitoring** – Immediate detection and response
- **Alert systems** – Notify security personnel of incidents

## Response and Recovery

### **Immediate Actions**
- **Challenge unauthorized individuals** – Confront suspicious persons
- **Escort out** – Remove unauthorized individuals from premises
- **Document incident** – Record all details of the incident
- **Notify security** – Alert security personnel immediately

### **Investigation Steps**
- **Review surveillance footage** – Examine video recordings
- **Interview witnesses** – Gather information from employees
- **Assess impact** – Determine what was accessed or compromised
- **Implement improvements** – Enhance security measures

## Best Practices

- **Challenge everyone** – Verify identity of all individuals
- **Use access controls** – Require proper authentication
- **Train employees** – Regular security awareness training
- **Monitor entrances** – Active surveillance of access points
- **Report incidents** – Document and report all suspicious activity
- **Regular security reviews** – Assess and improve security measures
