# PCI DSS (Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard)

PCI DSS is a set of security standards designed to ensure that all companies that process, store, or transmit credit card information maintain a secure environment. It is mandated by major credit card brands and enforced by payment processors.

## Understanding PCI DSS

### Definition
PCI DSS is a proprietary information security standard for organizations that handle branded credit cards from major card schemes including Visa, MasterCard, American Express, Discover, and JCB.

### Scope
- **Cardholder Data**: Primary account numbers, cardholder names
- **Sensitive Authentication Data**: Full magnetic stripe, CVV, PINs
- **Processing Systems**: Systems that process payment data
- **Storage Systems**: Systems that store payment data
- **Transmission Networks**: Networks that transmit payment data

### Compliance Levels
- **Level 1**: Over 6 million transactions annually
- **Level 2**: 1-6 million transactions annually
- **Level 3**: 20,000-1 million e-commerce transactions
- **Level 4**: Under 20,000 e-commerce transactions

## PCI DSS Requirements

### Build and Maintain a Secure Network
- **Requirement 1**: Install and maintain a firewall configuration
- **Requirement 2**: Do not use vendor-supplied defaults

### Protect Cardholder Data
- **Requirement 3**: Protect stored cardholder data
- **Requirement 4**: Encrypt transmission of cardholder data

### Maintain Vulnerability Management Program
- **Requirement 5**: Use and regularly update anti-virus software
- **Requirement 6**: Develop and maintain secure systems and applications

### Implement Strong Access Control Measures
- **Requirement 7**: Restrict access to cardholder data
- **Requirement 8**: Assign unique ID to each person with computer access
- **Requirement 9**: Restrict physical access to cardholder data

### Regularly Monitor and Test Networks
- **Requirement 10**: Track and monitor all access to network resources
- **Requirement 11**: Regularly test security systems and processes

### Maintain Information Security Policy
- **Requirement 12**: Maintain a policy that addresses information security
