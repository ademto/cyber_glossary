## What is a Backup?

A **Backup** is a safety copy of data that can be restored in case of accidental deletion, cyberattack, hardware failure, or natural disaster. It's a critical component of business continuity planning and data protection strategies.

## Backup Types

### **Full Backup**
- Complete copy of all data
- Takes longest to create and restore
- Provides fastest recovery time
- Used as baseline for other backup types

### **Incremental Backup**
- Only backs up changed data since last backup
- Fastest to create, slower to restore
- Requires full backup plus all incremental backups
- Efficient for storage space

### **Differential Backup**
- Backs up all changes since last full backup
- Moderate creation and restore times
- Requires full backup plus latest differential
- Good balance of speed and storage

## Backup Strategies

### **3-2-1 Rule**
- **3 copies** of important data
- **2 different storage types** (e.g., local drive + cloud)
- **1 copy offsite** for disaster protection

### **Backup Locations**
- **Local backups** – Fast access, vulnerable to local disasters
- **Cloud backups** – Scalable, requires internet connection
- **Offsite backups** – Disaster protection, slower access
- **Air-gapped backups** – Isolated from network, ransomware protection

## Best Practices

- **Automate backups** to ensure consistency
- **Test restore procedures** regularly
- **Encrypt backup data** for security
- **Monitor backup success** and failures
- **Document backup procedures** and recovery plans
- **Use versioning** to protect against ransomware
- **Implement retention policies** for compliance
- **Regular backup validation** to ensure data integrity
