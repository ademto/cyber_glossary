## What is a Honeypot?

**A Honeypot** is a decoy system, network, or application designed to attract and monitor cyber attackers. It appears to be a legitimate target but is actually isolated and monitored to gather intelligence about attack methods, tools, and techniques. Honeypots provide valuable insights into attacker behavior and help improve security defenses.

## Honeypot Types

### **Low-Interaction Honeypots**
- **Limited functionality** – Simulates basic services and responses
- **Low risk** – Minimal attack surface and compromise potential
- **Easy deployment** – Simple to set up and maintain
- **Basic monitoring** – Limited attack interaction capabilities
- **Cost-effective** – Minimal resource requirements

### **High-Interaction Honeypots**
- **Full functionality** – Complete operating system and services
- **Detailed monitoring** – Comprehensive attack interaction tracking
- **Realistic environment** – Closely mimics production systems
- **Higher risk** – Greater potential for compromise
- **Resource intensive** – Requires significant resources and expertise

### **Production Honeypots**
- **Mixed environment** – Deployed alongside real systems
- **Realistic appearance** – Indistinguishable from production systems
- **Active monitoring** – Continuous threat detection
- **Risk management** – Careful isolation and monitoring
- **Business value** – Direct protection of production assets
