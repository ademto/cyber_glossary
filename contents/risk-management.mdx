# Risk Management

Risk Management is the systematic process of identifying, assessing, prioritizing, and treating risks to minimize their potential impact on organizational objectives, operations, and assets. It provides a structured approach to making informed decisions about risk acceptance, avoidance, mitigation, or transfer.

## Risk Management Process
1. **Risk Identification**: Discover and document potential risks
2. **Risk Assessment**: Evaluate likelihood and impact of risks
3. **Risk Prioritization**: Rank risks based on severity and urgency
4. **Risk Treatment**: Implement strategies to address risks
5. **Risk Monitoring**: Continuously track and review risks

## Risk Categories

- **Operational Risks**: Risks affecting day-to-day operations
- **Financial Risks**: Risks affecting financial performance
- **Compliance Risks**: Risks of regulatory violations
- **Technology Risks**: Risks related to IT systems and infrastructure

## Risk Treatment Strategies
- **Risk Avoidance**: Eliminate the risk by avoiding the activity
- **Risk Mitigation**: Reduce the likelihood or impact of the risk
- **Risk Transfer**: Transfer risk to another party (e.g., insurance)
- **Risk Acceptance**: Accept the risk when cost of treatment exceeds benefit
