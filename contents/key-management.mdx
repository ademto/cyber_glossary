## What is Key Management?

**Key Management** ensures the secure lifecycle of encryption keys. Poor key handling can make even the strongest encryption useless.

## Lifecycle Steps

1. Generate strong keys
2. Securely distribute to systems
3. Rotate and retire regularly
4. Protect keys with hardware or dedicated services
5. Audit key usage

## Best Practices

- Use hardware-backed storage (HSMs)
- Isolate keys by environment (dev/prod)
- Use automatic key rotation
- Log and monitor all access
