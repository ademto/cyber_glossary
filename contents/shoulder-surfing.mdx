## What is Shoulder Surfing?

**Shoulder surfing** is a physical security attack where attackers observe users entering passwords, PINs, credit card numbers, or other sensitive information by looking over their shoulder or using other observation techniques. This attack can occur in public spaces, workplaces, or any location where sensitive information is entered.

## How Shoulder Surfing Works

### **Attack Methods**
- **Direct observation** – Looking over the victim's shoulder
- **Reflection techniques** – Using mirrors or reflective surfaces
- **Video recording** – Recording with cameras or smartphones
- **Binoculars or telescopes** – Long-distance observation
- **Hidden cameras** – Covert surveillance devices

### **Common Locations**
- **ATMs and banks** – PIN entry and banking activities
- **Public computers** – Internet cafes and libraries
- **Workplaces** – Office environments and cubicles
- **Public transportation** – Trains, buses, and airplanes
- **Retail locations** – Point-of-sale terminals

## Types of Information Targeted

### **Authentication Credentials**
- **Passwords** – Computer and online account passwords
- **PINs** – ATM, credit card, and phone PINs
- **Security codes** – Two-factor authentication codes
- **Access codes** – Building and system access codes

### **Personal Information**
- **Credit card numbers** – Card details and CVV codes
- **Social security numbers** – Personal identification numbers
- **Phone numbers** – Contact information
- **Addresses** – Personal and business addresses

## Detection and Prevention

### **Physical Security Measures**
- **Privacy screens** – Anti-glare and privacy filters
- **Positioning awareness** – Be aware of surroundings
- **Secure areas** – Use private spaces for sensitive input
- **Surveillance monitoring** – Security cameras and monitoring
- **Access controls** – Restrict access to sensitive areas

### **User Education**
- **Security awareness training** – Educate users about risks
- **Best practices** – Safe password entry techniques
- **Situational awareness** – Be mindful of surroundings
- **Reporting procedures** – Report suspicious activity

### **Technical Controls**
- **Multi-factor authentication** – Additional verification layers
- **Biometric authentication** – Fingerprint, facial recognition
- **Virtual keyboards** – On-screen keyboard entry
- **Session timeouts** – Automatic logout features
- **Encryption** – Protect sensitive data

## Response and Recovery

### **Immediate Actions**
- **Change compromised credentials** – Update passwords and PINs
- **Monitor accounts** – Watch for unauthorized activity
- **Report incidents** – Notify security teams
- **Document details** – Record incident information

### **Investigation Steps**
- **Review surveillance footage** – Check security cameras
- **Interview witnesses** – Gather additional information
- **Assess impact** – Determine scope of compromise
- **Implement improvements** – Enhance security measures

## Best Practices

- **Use privacy screens** – Protect against visual observation
- **Be aware of surroundings** – Check for suspicious activity
- **Use secure areas** – Enter sensitive information privately
- **Enable multi-factor authentication** – Additional security layers
- **Regular password changes** – Update credentials regularly
- **Report suspicious activity** – Help prevent future attacks
