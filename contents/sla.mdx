## What is a Service Level Agreement?

**A Service Level Agreement (SLA)** is a formal contract between a service provider and a customer that defines the level of service expected, including performance metrics, availability, response times, and other quality standards. SLAs are essential for establishing clear expectations and ensuring accountability in business relationships.

## SLA Core Components
