## What is an Insider Threat?

An **Insider Threat** is a security risk that originates from within an organization, involving individuals who have authorized access to systems, data, or facilities. These threats can be intentional (malicious) or unintentional (negligent) and are particularly dangerous because insiders already have legitimate access.

## Types of Insider Threats

### **Malicious Insiders**
- **Disgruntled employees** seeking revenge
- **Espionage** for financial gain or ideology
- **Sabotage** to damage systems or data
- **Data theft** for personal or competitive advantage

### **Negligent Insiders**
- **Human error** leading to data breaches
- **Poor security practices** (weak passwords, sharing credentials)
- **Accidental data exposure** through misconfiguration
- **Social engineering victims** who unwittingly help attackers

### **Compromised Insiders**
- **Credential theft** through phishing or malware
- **Account takeover** by external attackers
- **Privilege escalation** through exploited vulnerabilities

## Warning Signs

- **Unusual access patterns** (off-hours, excessive data access)
- **Behavioral changes** (disgruntled, financial stress)
- **Technical indicators** (unauthorized software, data transfers)
- **Policy violations** (bypassing security controls)

## Detection and Prevention

### **Technical Controls**
- User Behavior Analytics (UBA)
- Data Loss Prevention (DLP) tools
- Privileged Access Management (PAM)
- Comprehensive logging and monitoring

### **Organizational Measures**
- Regular access reviews and audits
- Security awareness training
- Clear policies and procedures
- Anonymous reporting mechanisms
- Exit procedures for departing employees

### **Best Practices**
- Implement the principle of least privilege
- Monitor privileged access closely
- Conduct background checks for sensitive roles
- Foster a positive work environment
- Have incident response plans for insider threats
