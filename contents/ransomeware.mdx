## What is Ransomware?

**Ransomware** is a type of malware that encrypts a victim’s files, rendering them inaccessible. The attacker then demands a ransom payment, often in cryptocurrency, in exchange for the decryption key.

## Common Variants

- **Crypto ransomware** – Encrypts data
- **Locker ransomware** – Locks user out of the system
- **Double extortion** – Threatens to leak stolen data

## Best Practices

- Maintain offline and cloud backups
- Educate staff on phishing awareness
- Patch software and close known vulnerabilities
- Implement email filtering and endpoint detection tools
