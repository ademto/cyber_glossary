# Botnet

A botnet is a network of compromised computers, servers, or IoT devices (called "bots" or "zombies") that are controlled by an attacker through a command and control (C&C) infrastructure. Botnets are used to perform various malicious activities while remaining hidden from the device owners.

## How Botnets Work
1. **Infection**: Malware infects devices through various vectors (phishing, vulnerabilities, etc.)
2. **Establishment**: Infected devices connect to C&C servers
3. **Control**: Attacker sends commands to the botnet
4. **Execution**: Bots perform malicious activities as directed

## Common Botnet Activities
- **DDoS Attacks**: Overwhelm target systems with traffic
- **Spam Distribution**: Send massive amounts of unwanted emails
- **Data Theft**: Steal sensitive information from infected devices
- **Cryptocurrency Mining**: Use device resources for mining operations
- **Click Fraud**: Generate fake clicks for advertising revenue

## Botnet Architecture
- **Centralized**: Single C&C server controls all bots
- **Decentralized**: Multiple C&C servers for redundancy
- **P2P**: Bots communicate directly with each other
- **Hybrid**: Combination of different architectures

## Detection and Prevention
1. **Network Monitoring**: Detect unusual traffic patterns
2. **Endpoint Protection**: Use antivirus and EDR solutions
3. **Patch Management**: Keep systems updated
4. **User Education**: Prevent initial infections
5. **C&C Blocking**: Block known command and control servers

## Notable Botnets
- **Mirai**: Targeted IoT devices for DDoS attacks
- **Conficker**: One of the largest botnets in history
- **Zeus**: Banking trojan botnet
- **Emotet**: Advanced banking trojan and botnet

## Incident Response
- Identify and isolate infected devices
- Remove malware and restore systems
- Block C&C communications
- Monitor for reinfection

## Related Concepts
- **DDoS Attack**: Common botnet activity
- **Command and Control**: Infrastructure for botnet control
- **Malware**: Software that creates botnets

## Conclusion

Botnets represent a significant threat to individuals and organizations. Prevention through security awareness, system updates, and monitoring is essential to avoid becoming part of a botnet.
