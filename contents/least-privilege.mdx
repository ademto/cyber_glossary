## What is Least Privilege?

The **Principle of Least Privilege (PoLP)** is about giving users and systems only the access they absolutely needâ€”and nothing more. It limits the blast radius of attacks and prevents accidental damage.

## Implementation Tactics

- Use role-based access
- Time-bound and just-in-time access
- Monitor and audit permission use
- Remove stale or unused accounts

## Best Practices

- Apply to humans and machines
- Integrate with Identity & Access Management (IAM)
- Automate access revocation
- Conduct frequent access reviews
