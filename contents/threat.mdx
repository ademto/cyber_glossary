# Threat

A threat is any circumstance or event that has the potential to cause harm to an information system, organization, or individuals through unauthorized access, destruction, disclosure, or modification of information. Understanding threats is fundamental to effective cybersecurity risk management.

## Understanding Threats

### Definition
A threat is a potential source of harm that could exploit a vulnerability to cause damage to an asset. Threats can be intentional (malicious) or unintentional (accidental) and can originate from various sources.

### Threat Components
- **Threat Actor**: The entity that poses the threat
- **Threat Capability**: The ability to carry out the threat
- **Threat Intent**: The motivation behind the threat
- **Threat Opportunity**: The chance to execute the threat

### Threat Characteristics
- **Probability**: Likelihood of the threat occurring
- **Impact**: Potential damage if the threat materializes
- **Velocity**: Speed at which the threat can cause damage
- **Sophistication**: Level of technical expertise required

## Types of Threats

- **Network Attacks**: DDoS, man-in-the-middle, packet sniffing
- **Application Attacks**: SQL injection, XSS, buffer overflows
- **System Vulnerabilities**: Software bugs, configuration errors

### Environmental Threats
- **Physical Security**: Theft, vandalism, sabotage
- **Infrastructure**: Utility failures, communication outages
- **Supply Chain**: Vendor failures, third-party risks
- **Regulatory**: Compliance violations, legal changes

## Threat Actors

### Cybercriminals
- **Motivation**: Financial gain through cybercrime
- **Targets**: Financial institutions, e-commerce, individuals
- **Methods**: Ransomware, phishing, credit card fraud
- **Resources**: Varying levels of technical sophistication

### Nation-State Actors
- **Motivation**: Political, economic, or military objectives
- **Targets**: Government agencies, critical infrastructure
- **Methods**: Advanced persistent threats, espionage
- **Resources**: Significant technical and financial resources

### Hacktivists
- **Motivation**: Political or social causes
- **Targets**: Government, corporations, organizations
- **Methods**: Website defacement, data leaks, DDoS
- **Resources**: Moderate technical capabilities

### Insiders
- **Motivation**: Financial gain, revenge, ideology
- **Targets**: Their own organization
- **Methods**: Data theft, sabotage, fraud
- **Resources**: Legitimate access to systems

## Threat Modeling

### STRIDE Framework
- **Spoofing**: Impersonating legitimate users or systems
- **Tampering**: Unauthorized modification of data
- **Repudiation**: Denying actions or transactions
- **Information Disclosure**: Unauthorized access to information
- **Denial of Service**: Preventing legitimate access
- **Elevation of Privilege**: Gaining unauthorized privileges

### PASTA Framework
- **Stage 1**: Define objectives
- **Stage 2**: Define technical scope
- **Stage 3**: Application decomposition
- **Stage 4**: Threat analysis
- **Stage 5**: Vulnerability analysis
- **Stage 6**: Attack modeling
- **Stage 7**: Risk analysis

### Attack Trees
- **Root Node**: The attack goal
- **Child Nodes**: Methods to achieve the goal
- **Leaf Nodes**: Specific attack techniques
- **Probability**: Likelihood of each attack path
