# Pretexting

Pretexting is a social engineering technique in which an attacker fabricates a scenario (pretext) to trick a target into revealing sensitive information or performing actions that compromise security. The attacker often impersonates a trusted individual or authority to gain the victim's trust.

## How Pretexting Works
- **Scenario Creation**: Attacker invents a believable story or identity
- **Engagement**: Attacker contacts the target (phone, email, in-person)
- **Manipulation**: Uses the pretext to request sensitive information or access
- **Exploitation**: Uses obtained information for further attacks or fraud

## Common Pretexts
- IT support requesting login credentials
- Bank representative verifying account details
- Law enforcement seeking confidential information
- Vendor requesting payment or contract details

## Prevention and Detection
1. **Security Awareness Training**: Educate employees about social engineering
2. **Verification Procedures**: Always verify identities before sharing information
3. **Incident Reporting**: Encourage reporting of suspicious requests
4. **Access Controls**: Limit access to sensitive information

## Real-World Examples
- Attackers posing as HR to obtain employee data
- Impersonating executives to authorize wire transfers
- Fake IT support calls to reset passwords

## Related Concepts
- **Phishing**: Deceptive emails or messages
- **Vishing**: Voice-based attacks
- **Impersonation**: Pretending to be someone else

## Conclusion

Pretexting is a powerful social engineering tactic. Organizations must train employees, enforce verification procedures, and foster a culture of security awareness to defend against these attacks.
