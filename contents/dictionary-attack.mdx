# Dictionary Attack

A dictionary attack is a password-cracking technique that systematically tests words from a predefined list (dictionary) to guess passwords. Attackers use dictionaries of common passwords, phrases, and variations to speed up the process compared to brute force attacks.

## How Dictionary Attacks Work
- **Wordlist Selection**: Use of dictionaries containing common passwords
- **Automated Tools**: Tools like John the Ripper, Hydra, and Hashcat automate the process
- **Password Guessing**: Each word is tried as a password until access is gained or the list is exhausted

## Prevention
1. **Use Strong Passwords**: Avoid common words and phrases
2. **Password Complexity**: Require a mix of letters, numbers, and symbols
3. **Salting and Hashing**: Store passwords securely
4. **Account Lockout**: Limit login attempts to prevent automated attacks

## Detection
- Monitor for repeated failed login attempts
- Use intrusion detection systems (IDS)
- Analyze authentication logs for patterns

## Related Concepts
- **Brute Force Attack**: Tries all possible combinations
- **Password Cracking**: General term for breaking passwords
- **Salting**: Enhances password security

## Conclusion

Dictionary attacks are a common and effective method for cracking weak passwords. Strong password policies and monitoring are essential to defend against these attacks.
