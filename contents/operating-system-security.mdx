# Operating System Security

Operating System Security involves protecting operating systems through various security controls, hardening techniques, monitoring, and management practices to prevent unauthorized access and maintain system integrity.

## Understanding OS Security

### Definition
Operating System Security is the implementation of security controls and practices to protect operating systems from threats, vulnerabilities, and unauthorized access while maintaining system functionality and performance.

### Purpose
