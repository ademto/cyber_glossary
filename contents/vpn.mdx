## What is a VPN?

A **Virtual Private Network (VPN)** creates an encrypted tunnel between your device and the internet. It hides your IP address, protects your data from snoopers, and can allow access to restricted resources.

## How It Works

- Encrypts all data leaving your device
- Routes traffic through a remote server
- Masks location and hides activity from ISPs

## Best Practices

- Use strong, modern VPN protocols (WireGuard, OpenVPN)
- Avoid free VPNs with poor security records
- Configure split tunneling carefully
- Use MFA when connecting to corporate VPNs
