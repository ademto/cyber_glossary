## What is Salting?

**Salting** is a cryptographic technique that adds random data (called a "salt") to passwords before hashing them. This process prevents rainbow table attacks and ensures that even identical passwords produce different hash values, significantly improving password security and protecting against various attack methods.

## How Salting Works

### **Basic Process**
- **Password input** – User provides password
- **Salt generation** – Random salt is generated
- **Combination** – Password and salt are combined
- **Hashing** – Combined value is hashed
- **Storage** – Hash and salt are stored together

### **Salt Properties**
- **Randomness** – Cryptographically secure random values
- **Uniqueness** – Each password gets a unique salt
- **Length** – Sufficient length (typically 16+ bytes)
- **Storage** – Salt stored alongside hash
- **Retrieval** – Salt retrieved during verification

### **Verification Process**
- **Password input** – User provides password for verification
- **Salt retrieval** – Salt retrieved from storage
- **Combination** – Password and salt combined
- **Hashing** – Combined value hashed
- **Comparison** – Hash compared with stored hash

## Types of Salting

### **Per-Password Salting**
- **Unique salt** – Each password gets unique salt
- **Maximum security** – Highest level of protection
- **Storage overhead** – Requires storing salt per password
- **Implementation** – Standard practice for password storage
- **Benefits** – Prevents rainbow table attacks completely

### **Per-User Salting**
- **User-specific salt** – Same salt for all user passwords
- **Moderate security** – Better than no salt, less than per-password
- **Storage efficiency** – One salt per user
- **Implementation** – Used in some legacy systems
- **Limitations** – Vulnerable to targeted attacks

### **Application-Level Salting**
- **Global salt** – Same salt for all passwords in application
- **Minimal security** – Provides very limited protection
- **Storage efficiency** – Single salt for entire application
- **Implementation** – Sometimes used in simple systems
- **Vulnerabilities** – Still vulnerable to rainbow table attacks

## Salt Generation Methods

### **Cryptographically Secure Random**
- **Secure algorithms** – Use cryptographically secure random generators
- **Entropy sources** – High-quality entropy sources
- **Random length** – Variable salt length for additional security
- **Implementation** – Standard practice for modern systems
- **Examples** – /dev/urandom, CryptoAPI, SecureRandom

### **Time-Based Salting**
- **Timestamp inclusion** – Include current timestamp in salt
- **Additional entropy** – Adds time-based randomness
- **Implementation** – Sometimes used as additional entropy
- **Limitations** – Predictable if timestamp is known
- **Best practice** – Combine with cryptographically secure random

### **Hardware-Based Salting**
- **Hardware RNG** – Use hardware random number generators
- **High entropy** – Very high-quality entropy sources
- **Implementation** – Used in high-security environments
- **Cost** – May require specialized hardware
- **Reliability** – Hardware failure considerations

## Implementation Best Practices

### **Salt Generation**
- **Cryptographically secure** – Use secure random number generators
- **Sufficient length** – Minimum 16 bytes (128 bits)
- **Uniqueness** – Ensure each salt is unique
- **Randomness** – High-quality entropy sources
- **Verification** – Validate salt quality

### **Salt Storage**
- **Secure storage** – Store salts securely alongside hashes
- **No encryption** – Salts should not be encrypted
- **Access control** – Restrict access to salt storage
- **Backup security** – Secure backup of salt data
- **Retrieval efficiency** – Efficient salt retrieval mechanisms

### **Salt Application**
- **Consistent application** – Apply salt consistently
- **Proper combination** – Combine password and salt correctly
- **Hash selection** – Use appropriate hash functions
- **Iteration count** – Combine with key stretching
- **Verification** – Test salt application thoroughly

## Implementation Examples

### **Modern Password Storage**
```python
import hashlib
import os
import bcrypt

# Generate salt
salt = bcrypt.gensalt()

# Hash password with salt
hashed = bcrypt.hashpw(password.encode('utf-8'), salt)

# Store hash and salt
store_password_hash(hashed)
```

### **Legacy System Upgrade**
```python
import hashlib
import os

# Generate new salt
salt = os.urandom(16)

# Combine password and salt
salted_password = password + salt.hex()

# Hash combined value
hash_value = hashlib.sha256(salted_password.encode()).hexdigest()

# Store hash and salt
store_password_data(hash_value, salt.hex())
```

### **Verification Process**
```python
def verify_password(stored_hash, stored_salt, input_password):
    # Combine input password with stored salt
    salted_input = input_password + stored_salt
    
    # Hash combined value
    input_hash = hashlib.sha256(salted_input.encode()).hexdigest()
    
    # Compare hashes
    return input_hash == stored_hash
```
