# Risk Mitigation

Risk mitigation is the process of implementing strategies and controls to reduce the likelihood or impact of identified risks to acceptable levels within an organization. It is a key component of comprehensive risk management programs.

## Understanding Risk Mitigation

### Definition
Risk mitigation involves taking actions to reduce the probability of a risk occurring or to minimize its impact if it does occur. It includes implementing controls, policies, and procedures to address identified risks.

### Risk Mitigation Objectives
- **Risk Reduction**: Reduce risk to acceptable levels
- **Control Implementation**: Implement appropriate controls
- **Cost Optimization**: Optimize mitigation costs
- **Compliance**: Ensure regulatory compliance

### Risk Mitigation Principles
- **Proportionality**: Mitigation proportional to risk level
