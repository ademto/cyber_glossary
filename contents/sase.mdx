# SASE

Secure Access Service Edge (SASE) is a cloud-based security model that combines network security functions with wide-area networking (WAN) capabilities to support the dynamic, secure access needs of organizations. SASE converges network and security point solutions into a unified, global cloud-native service.

## What is SASE?

SASE is an emerging cybersecurity concept that combines software-defined wide area networking (SD-WAN) capabilities with network security functions like secure web gateways (SWG), cloud access security brokers (CASB), firewall-as-a-service (FWaaS), and zero-trust network access (ZTNA) into a single, cloud-delivered service model.

## Core Components

### Software-Defined Wide Area Network (SD-WAN)
- **Dynamic Path Selection**: Automatically routes traffic over optimal paths
- **Bandwidth Aggregation**: Combines multiple WAN links for better performance
- **Application-Aware Routing**: Routes traffic based on application requirements
- **Centralized Management**: Unified management of distributed networks

### Secure Web Gateway (SWG)
- **Web Filtering**: Blocks access to malicious websites and content
- **URL Filtering**: Controls access based on URL categories
- **Malware Protection**: Scans web traffic for malicious content
- **Data Loss Prevention**: Prevents unauthorized data exfiltration

### Cloud Access Security Broker (CASB)
- **Cloud Application Discovery**: Identifies and monitors cloud application usage
- **Data Protection**: Encrypts and controls access to cloud data
- **Threat Protection**: Detects and prevents cloud-based threats
- **Compliance Monitoring**: Ensures compliance with security policies

### Firewall-as-a-Service (FWaaS)
- **Next-Generation Firewall**: Advanced threat protection and inspection
- **Intrusion Prevention**: Blocks network-based attacks
- **Application Control**: Controls access to applications and services
- **Advanced Threat Protection**: Sandboxing and behavioral analysis

### Zero Trust Network Access (ZTNA)
- **Identity-Based Access**: Access control based on user identity
- **Application-Level Security**: Secure access to specific applications
- **Micro-segmentation**: Isolates applications and services
- **Continuous Verification**: Ongoing authentication and authorization

## SASE Architecture
