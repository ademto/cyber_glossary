## What is Penetration Testing?

**Penetration Testing** (pentesting) is a proactive cybersecurity practice where authorized security professionals simulate real-world attacks to identify vulnerabilities and test the effectiveness of security controls. It goes beyond automated scanning to actively exploit weaknesses.

## Phases of a Pen Test

### 1. **Planning & Reconnaissance**
- Define scope and objectives
- Gather information about the target
- Identify potential attack vectors

### 2. **Scanning & Enumeration**
- Use tools to discover open ports and services
- Map the network architecture
- Identify potential vulnerabilities

### 3. **Exploitation**
- Attempt to exploit identified vulnerabilities
- Gain unauthorized access to systems
- Escalate privileges where possible

### 4. **Post-Exploitation**
- Document the extent of access gained
- Identify sensitive data and systems
- Test persistence mechanisms

### 5. **Reporting & Remediation**
- Document all findings with evidence
- Provide actionable remediation steps
- Rate vulnerabilities by severity

## Types of Penetration Tests

- **Black Box** – No prior knowledge of the target
- **White Box** – Full knowledge of systems and architecture
- **Gray Box** – Limited knowledge of the target
- **Web Application** – Focused on web-based systems
- **Network** – Testing network infrastructure
- **Social Engineering** – Testing human vulnerabilities

## Best Practices

- Clearly define scope and rules of engagement
- Use professional, certified testers
- Combine automated and manual methods
- Remediate findings promptly
- Conduct regular testing (quarterly or annually)
- Document all activities and findings
