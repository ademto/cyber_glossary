## What is Penetration Testing?

**Penetration Testing** is a proactive cybersecurity practice where ethical hackers simulate attacks to find security flaws. It mimics the actions of real attackers to test the effectiveness of security controls.

## Phases of a Pen Test

1. **Reconnaissance**
2. **Scanning & Enumeration**
3. **Exploitation**
4. **Post-Exploitation**
5. **Reporting**

## Best Practices

- Clearly define scope and rules of engagement
- Use professional third-party testers
- Combine automated and manual methods
- Remediate findings promptly
