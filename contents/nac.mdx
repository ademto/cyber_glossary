## What is Network Access Control?

**Network Access Control (NAC)** is a security technology that controls access to network resources based on device compliance, user identity, and security policies. NAC solutions ensure that only authorized and compliant devices can access network resources, providing enhanced security and visibility.

## NAC Core Components

### **Policy Engine**
- **Access policies** – Define network access policies
- **Compliance policies** – Define device compliance requirements
- **Enforcement policies** – Define policy enforcement actions
- **Policy management** – Manage and update policies
- **Policy distribution** – Distribute policies to enforcement points

### **Assessment Engine**
- **Device assessment** – Assess device security posture
- **Compliance checking** – Check device compliance with policies
- **Vulnerability scanning** – Scan devices for vulnerabilities
- **Health checking** – Check device health and status
- **Risk assessment** – Assess device risk level

### **Enforcement Engine**
- **Access control** – Control network access based on policies
- **Quarantine** – Quarantine non-compliant devices
- **Remediation** – Guide devices through remediation
- **Monitoring** – Monitor device compliance status
- **Reporting** – Report on compliance and access

## NAC Deployment Models

### **Pre-Admission NAC**
