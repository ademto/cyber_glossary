# Digital Signature

Digital signatures are cryptographic techniques that provide authentication, integrity, and non-repudiation for digital documents and messages. They use public key cryptography to create a mathematical proof that a message was created by a specific sender and has not been altered.

## How Digital Signatures Work

### Key Components
- **Private Key**: Used by the signer to create signatures
- **Public Key**: Used by verifiers to verify signatures
- **Hash Function**: Creates a unique fingerprint of the message
- **Signature Algorithm**: Mathematical process to create signatures

### Signature Process
1. **Message Hashing**: Create hash of the original message
2. **Private Key Encryption**: Encrypt hash with signer's private key
3. **Signature Creation**: The encrypted hash becomes the signature
4. **Message Transmission**: Send message with signature

### Verification Process
1. **Message Reception**: Receive message and signature
2. **Hash Calculation**: Calculate hash of received message
3. **Public Key Decryption**: Decrypt signature with signer's public key
4. **Hash Comparison**: Compare calculated and decrypted hashes

## Digital Signature Properties

### Authentication
- **Identity Verification**: Confirms the identity of the signer
- **Public Key Binding**: Links signature to specific public key
- **Certificate Validation**: Verifies signer's digital certificate
- **Trust Chain**: Establishes trust through certificate authorities

### Integrity
- **Message Integrity**: Ensures message has not been altered
- **Hash Verification**: Detects any changes to the message
- **Tamper Detection**: Identifies unauthorized modifications
- **Data Consistency**: Maintains data consistency

### Non-repudiation
- **Proof of Origin**: Provides proof of message origin
- **Legal Evidence**: Admissible as legal evidence
- **Binding Commitment**: Creates binding commitment by signer
- **Audit Trail**: Creates verifiable audit trail

## Digital Signature Algorithms

### RSA Digital Signatures
- **Algorithm**: RSA-PSS, RSA-PKCS#1 v1.5
- **Key Size**: 2048 bits minimum, 4096 bits recommended
- **Security**: Based on integer factorization problem
- **Performance**: Slower than elliptic curve algorithms

### DSA (Digital Signature Algorithm)
- **Algorithm**: FIPS 186-4 standard
- **Key Size**: 2048 bits minimum
- **Security**: Based on discrete logarithm problem
- **Performance**: Efficient signature generation and verification

### ECDSA (Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm)
- **Algorithm**: Elliptic curve variant of DSA
- **Key Size**: 256 bits (equivalent to 3072-bit RSA)
- **Security**: Based on elliptic curve discrete logarithm
- **Performance**: Faster than RSA with smaller key sizes

### EdDSA (Edwards-curve Digital Signature Algorithm)
- **Algorithm**: Ed25519, Ed448
- **Key Size**: 256 bits (Ed25519), 448 bits (Ed448)
- **Security**: High security with small key sizes
- **Performance**: Very fast signature generation and verification

## Public Key Infrastructure (PKI)

### Certificate Authorities (CAs)
- **Trust Anchors**: Establish trust in digital certificates
- **Certificate Issuance**: Issue and manage digital certificates
- **Certificate Revocation**: Revoke compromised certificates
- **Trust Validation**: Validate certificate trust chains

### Digital Certificates
- **Identity Binding**: Bind public keys to identities
- **Certificate Format**: X.509 standard format
- **Certificate Fields**: Subject, issuer, validity period, extensions
- **Certificate Validation**: Verify certificate authenticity and validity

- **CRL (Certificate Revocation List)**: List of revoked certificates
- **OCSP (Online Certificate Status Protocol)**: Real-time certificate validation
- **Revocation Reasons**: Compromise, key change, affiliation change
- **Revocation Checking**: Verify certificate revocation status

## Applications
