## What is a Digital Signature?

A **Digital Signature** is a mathematical scheme based on public key cryptography that ensures the recipient knows a message or file came from a specific sender and was not altered in transit.

## How It Works

- Sender hashes the message
- Hash is encrypted with sender's private key
- Recipient decrypts with senderâ€™s public key and compares hashes

## Best Practices

- Use trusted certificate authorities (CAs)
- Keep private keys secure
- Use digital signatures for legal documents, software distribution, and secure emails
- Verify signature validity before trusting content
