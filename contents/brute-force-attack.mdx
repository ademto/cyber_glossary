## What is a Brute Force Attack?

A **Brute Force Attack** involves guessing login credentials or encryption keys by systematically trying all possible combinations until the correct one is found.

## Common Types

- **Simple brute force** – Tries every combination
- **Dictionary attack** – Uses known wordlists
- **Credential stuffing** – Tries known username-password pairs

## Best Practices

- Enforce strong password policies
- Use rate limiting and account lockouts
- Deploy multi-factor authentication (MFA)
- Monitor login attempts and failed logins
